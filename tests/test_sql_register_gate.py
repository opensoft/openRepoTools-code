"""THE LANDING GATE, T280: ITS TEN CASES (Brett's "Temporary landing gate
(Recommended)", 2026-11-13; FR-059). TEMPORARY: T281 removes this module with
the gate, in the last set.

`tests/conftest.py`'s hook, through its reader `tests/sql_register_gate.py`,
skips each 007 test whose tasks have not all landed, and the skip names them.
A test waits for what its module's `SQL_REGISTER_GATE_TABLE` says. A task has
landed when its marker is in `tests/sql_register_landed/`. The gate is active
only in a GitHub Actions run whose workflow is not `verify` and whose ref is
not a `verify/` branch, unless `SQL_REGISTER_GATE` is `on` or `off` (lane 3's
rulings, 2026-11-13, and (b), 2026-11-14, opensoft/openRepoTools#165 comments
6867533114 and 6870017590). Eight cases are T280's; the ninth is (b)'s; the
tenth, a gated run with no marker directory, is lane 2's review RV26's.

EACH CASE RUNS A CHILD PYTEST, since a table or a marker the gate cannot read
ends the session that reads it. The child runs in a code root of the case's
own, made of:
  * a copy of this suite's `conftest.py` and the local modules it imports, so
    the hook under test is the suite's own, byte for byte;
  * a probe module with a table;
  * a module with no table;
  * the marker directory the case writes.

The child sees no `GITHUB_*`, `SQL_REGISTER_GATE`, `OPENREPOTOOLS_*`, `PG*` or
`PYTEST_*` of the outer run, only what the case sets. It reports each id
through a JUnit file, which names the reason of every skip.

The cases about WHEN the gate is active also ask the reader's `active()`
directly. That covers the refs a child cannot be put on cheaply: a pull
request's head, the merge queue's branches, and a `verify/` head.
