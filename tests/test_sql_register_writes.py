"""Feature 007's test 2 (AT-2; opensoft/openRepoTools#165): a register write
exits 69 when the database is unreachable, with nothing written.

THIS MODULE holds test 2's storage-layer case, phase N (the test plan's
section 1.3; lane 2's T210):
`test_the_storage_layer_entry_exits_69_when_the_database_is_unreachable`;
and test 2's per-verb cases, its refused transactions, its partial failures
and S1's other tests, phase W, lane 2's T241 (see "phase W: T241" below),
with lane 3's reading 3 of T112, an image holding a CR or a NUL refused with
2 by `register commit`, and lane 3's Q35, `request-handoff`'s refusals before
its claim, 64 and never 2 (T241d).

THE STORAGE-LAYER ENTRY is the managed projection writer's (design S4), driven
by the fake writer AT-1's part N drives it with,
`test_sql_register_render.py`'s `projection_entry`: one attempt of S1's loop,
`register snapshot --write-id new ... --tree <dir> --checkout <c>` (contract
section 3.2), then, on 0 alone, the attempt directory and `register commit`
(section 3.3), as the verb `managed-projection`.

WHY THE 69 IS THE SNAPSHOT'S. With the database unreachable, the entry's first
call is a read, and a read that cannot reach its database is 69 (contract
section 2.7, "On a read"; section 3.2's exits; AT-2's outcome table, "no
connection at the first snapshot is 69"). `register commit` against an
unreachable database is 3, in doubt, never 69 (section 2.7, CO-5 and CO-6;
lane 1's T112 builds it so), so the entry never reaches it: the writer
abandons on a snapshot's 69 (section 3.3, "The caller's map"). The case fails
until L1-A9 (lane 1's T111, `register snapshot`) lands, and, for the flipped
copy, L1-A4 (T105's constant).

THE FAULT, WITH NO ENGINE (AT-2's "Unreachable"): the configuration's
`register_url=` names a fresh, empty socket directory, and the `psql` first on
`PATH` is T203's register fake, which since T203b answers T106's `psql
--version` itself with 16.4 (logged as its own kind, and left out of
`fake_calls`), and every call that carries a request with `psql`'s own exit 2
and its "connection to server ... failed" text, as the real `psql` answers an
empty socket directory. The fake's log is the oracle for what reached the store:
one call, the snapshot's, with no `commit_write` in it, the configured
password file and no `PGPASSWORD`, and no call after it (no retry that reads
as a write, and no fallback). With no request that reached a database, the
register's rows and the journal are unchanged; on the real engine, the
per-verb cases (T241) read them back by digest.

# plan's lines 646-781; FR-018, FR-019, FR-026, FR-059). Each of S1's writes
# runs as `lanes-edit.sh <verb>` on a `mode=primary` workstation, from the
# flipped copy (T203's, `RENDER_GIT_HALF = True`) with `lanes-edit.sh` beside
# it, so the verb's `lanes-index` is that copy (CLI4.5 section 6's copy rule).
#
# THE VERBS are S1's writes but `commit` (the test plan's line 750): the
# fourteen arms of `lanes-edit.sh`'s write dispatch at a2073eae (`:16537`),
# `commit` left out, whose direct write is 2 (D10). Each runs once, with the
# argument list `WRITE_VERBS` gives it; `log` runs once, as `log NOTED`.
#
# NO ENGINE (FP): the database unreachable, as a fake `psql` (T203's register
# fake, which answers T106's `--version` itself) that exits 2 with `psql`'s own
# "connection to server ... failed" text; D10's refusals; the queued commits;
# `request-handoff`'s 64s before its claim.
# REAL ENGINE (RE, on `pg`, skipped without PostgreSQL 16 by T205's banner):
# the switch not `primary`, the refused GRANTs, the late statement, the lock,
# the pending hand edit and the service down, each over test 1's imported
# register (`import_to_primary`, AT-LR006's route).
#
# They fail until lane 4's L4-B3 (T415's attempt loop), L4-B4 and L4-B11
# (T420, D10's refusals) land, each by its own assertion here: today's

#
# R02 (lane 1, #165 6755590769; lane 3, 6755615338; F10-OWED items 35 and
# 37): after LR004, `register commit` re-reads once and never resends. No case
# here meets LR004; the refused-transaction and late-statement cases assert
# that a refused commit call is never sent again, so a resend under any
# refusal fails them. LR004's own cases are T221's (`lr004_on_an_edit`,
# `lr004_reloads_once`).
#
# LANE 3'S READING 3 OF T112 (#165 6755386771; F10-OWED item 31): the

# not set. Each refuses with nothing sent: 2 for every verb but
# `request-handoff`, which refuses 64, never 2, since `lane` reads a 2 from it
# as "lane <L> is still bound elsewhere" (REV415b NIT 6's reason). `lane`
# calls it with no `LANES_LANE` (lane 4's question 35), and lane 3 rules that
# `lane` sets it (T432), and that the verb's refusal is 64 all the same.
