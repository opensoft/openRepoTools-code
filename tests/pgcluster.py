"""A REAL POSTGRESQL 16 FOR THE TESTS THAT NEED ONE (#165, L2-0a and L2-0b).

What only an engine decides, a fake `psql` cannot show: a SERIALIZABLE
conflict's 40001, a GRANT that refuses, a COMMIT whose session dies. This is
the fixture those tests run on, R1's option (a) as the test plan's section
3.1 settles it, from the fixture probe's prototype (sha256 `5f20d742…`).
Python 3.9 or later, standard library only. `tests/conftest.py` registers it
as a pytest plugin from its `pytest_configure`.

ONE DISPOSABLE CLUSTER PER SESSION. `initdb -N` into a 0700
`mkdtemp(prefix="orpg-", dir="/tmp")`, whose socket path is 32 bytes whatever
`TMPDIR` is; a postmaster started by `Popen` on that Unix socket alone, with
no TCP; and one database per test, cloned from the session's template. A
`Popen` postmaster stays in pytest's process group, so `tests/run.sh`'s stop
of the group reaches it, where `pg_ctl`'s would not; on Linux it also dies
with a SIGKILLed pytest, and the next session's start sweeps what a killed
one left.

THE FIXTURES:

  * `pg_engine`, session-scoped: the binaries, found once. EVERY CLUSTER
    DEPENDS ON IT, so a test whose fixture closure holds it is a real-engine
    test, which is how `test_sql_register_fixture.py` tells one apart;
  * `pg_template_sql`, session-scoped and overridable: how the template is
    built. By default it is `Bootstrap()`, P8's bootstrap (T227, below); a
    module may return SQL of its own instead, run on an empty `tmpl`;
  * `pg_cluster`, session-scoped: the session's cluster, with the template
    `tmpl` built, then closed to connections, and `tmpl_imported` beside it;
  * `pg`, one database per test, `CREATE DATABASE t_<n> TEMPLATE tmpl`, then
    section 1.4's two database-level statements, and dropped `WITH (FORCE)`
    at its teardown;
  * `pg_imported`, the same from `tmpl_imported`, the imported register: a
    case that clones it fails, saying why, where the session has none;
  * `stoppable_cluster`, a cluster of the test's own, built like the
    session's, for the tests that stop the database: `stop()` is a fast
    shutdown, SIGINT and a wait, and `start_again()` starts it on the same
    data and socket directories.

THE TEMPLATES (T227; the test plan's section 3.1, "The templates"). `tmpl` is
built on each cluster by P8's bootstrap, `lanes-index bootstrap --no-passwords`
(lane 1's T109, L1-A7), run through the admin service as AT-P8's fixture runs
it: a libpq service in `~/.pg_service.conf` of the cluster's own 0700 `admin`
home, naming the cluster's socket, its superuser and the database, so no
connection string is ever an argument. It makes the schema, the owner, the
groups REGISTER-WRITER and READER, the indexer's login and their GRANTs, and
labels the switch `register-test`. Then the fixture's logins are made (T228:
`lanes-index login add fx` and `login add --dump-job`, through the same service
under a pty, since `login` refuses off a terminal): `lanes_w_fx` and
`lanes_r_fx`, as which every session a test runs as REGISTER-WRITER or as
READER logs in, and `lanes_register_dump`; their passwords stay in memory for
`passfile()`. Then `tmpl` is marked `IS_TEMPLATE true
ALLOW_CONNECTIONS false`. A clone does not copy `pg_database.datacl`, so each
clone runs section 1.4's `REVOKE ALL ON DATABASE` and `GRANT CONNECT`, with
`-v db=` its name; the first run prints what a clone's `datacl` held before
them (open point 12). On the session cluster, `tmpl_imported` is cloned from
`tmpl`, with test 7's fixture register imported by `lanes-index import --at
<C>` (lane 1's T115, L1-A13), as the operator lane does it (T227b): the
register, AT-7's, is built on a repository of the fixture's own (a bare origin,
the operator lane's checkout that `LANES_REPO` names, and W, a view that is
never it), and the import runs as `lanes_w_fx` while the switch reads `files`
with the marker `absent`. Where it does not import, there is no
`tmpl_imported`, the run's foot says why, and the cases that clone it fail; a
bootstrap that fails fails each real-engine test, saying so.

The binaries' directory goes first on `PATH` while a cluster is up, so the
code under test runs the `psql` of the server it talks to, and every
subprocess the fixture runs has no inherited `PG*` variable.

THE SWITCH, `OPENREPOTOOLS_REQUIRE_PG`, unset, `0` or `1`, and nothing else.
Where no PostgreSQL 16 is found, or the run is root (`initdb` refuses root):

  * unset or `0`, every real-engine test SKIPS, naming each place tried,
    `PG_BIN` and the package, and a banner says so even under `-q`;
  * `1`, as CI sets it, `pytest_configure` refuses the run before any test,
    `UsageError`, exit 4. The refusal is EAGER: a run that selects no
    real-engine test is refused too, so a job cannot go green without the
    engine it was promised.

The binaries are `PG_BIN`, which is final (one that fails is reported, never
replaced), then `pg_config --bindir`, then `/usr/lib/postgresql/16/bin`. Each
candidate needs `initdb`, `pg_ctl`, `postgres` and `psql`, all saying
`(PostgreSQL) 16`. Where they were found is printed at the run's foot whenever
they were looked for, which under the switch is every run (open point 12).

THE SMOKE, `python3 -I -B tests/pgcluster.py --smoke <name>…`, runs without
pytest. `session` starts a cluster, clones a database from an empty template
and runs `SELECT 1` in it; `stoppable` starts a cluster, stops it by SIGINT,
starts it again on the same directories and runs `SELECT 1`. It exits 0 when
each named smoke passes, 1 when one fails or there is no engine, and 2 for a
name it does not know.
