"""AT-LR007 and AT-LR011: the order of `commit_write`'s first checks, and
`find_write` (#165; FR-008, FR-016).

PHASE N, ON A REAL POSTGRESQL 16, by direct calls to lane 1's SQL (design.md
§1.3, §1.3.1). `commit_write` takes the head row's lock, then checks the
generation (LR007 `generation`), then the write id (LR006, or LR007
`another-write` for another write's entry), and only then the head (LR001),
the version (LR003) and the switch (LR002), so a write id of another
generation never ends in 69 or 0 (V2's S-3). `find_write`, F3's one lookup,
waits on the server's clock, holding no lock, until it has passed
`p_not_after`, at most 3 s (LR011 past that); then it takes the head row's
lock under the caller's `lock_timeout`, checks the clock again, then the
generation, then the entry, and returns the write's seq, or NULL.

THE FIXTURE, AT-LR006'S, ON A CLONE OF ITS OWN: each test clones `tmpl`
(T205 makes it, T227 builds it by the bootstrap), as T221's `[new-write]`
does, runs §1.4's two database-level statements on the clone, and drops it
`WITH (FORCE)` at the end. Nothing needs `tmpl_imported` (lane 3, #165
6768050756 point 1, which lane 2 accepts; R-F11-23), so T114 need not wait for
T115. A clone of `tmpl` is at `files` with the marker `absent` and an empty
journal, and each test brings it where it needs by AT-LR006's route
(TP:4610–4615), by the documented functions as `lanes_w_fx` and nothing else:
`Clone.imported` commits an `import` entry (one file, `lanes/LANES.md`, of one
line), which is what a clone of `tmpl_imported` held, and `Clone.to_primary`
goes on with a `cutover` entry over that import, then `record_marker`:

  * database R, between a re-import's bootstrap and its cutover: the clone
    after `Clone.imported`, at `files` with the marker `absent`, whose
    generation is `g1`; `g0`, the lost database's, is a uuid of the test's
    own;
  * database S, a restore: the clone brought to `primary` with the marker
    `present` by `Clone.to_primary` (the import, a `cutover` entry over it,
    then `record_marker`: TP:4610–4615), standing in for a restored
    backup. W0 and W1 commit under its generation `g0`; then its restore-form
    cutover, an after-loss `cutover` entry whose label is not the switch's,
    sets a new generation `g1`, and `record_marker` confirms it; then W2
    commits under `g1`;
  * AT-LR011's: S's route to `primary`, with write W committed (lane L1,
    verb V, `args_sha256` a).

Every call logs in as the fixture's writer login, `lanes_w_fx` (T228), in
the commit call's own form, `psql -X -q -A -t -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -v
VERBOSITY=verbose -v SHOW_CONTEXT=never` with the script on stdin, so a
refusal's first stderr line is `ERROR:  <SQLSTATE>: <message>` and its second
the `DETAIL:` token. A lookup runs at READ COMMITTED in a transaction the test
rolls back, with D9's bounds set in it (`lock_timeout=2000ms`,
`statement_timeout=6000ms`). A holder of the head row is a superuser session
fed on stdin, and every barrier is a state polled in `pg_stat_activity`, by
the session's `application_name`. No elapsed time is asserted: the one time
read, `clock_timestamp()` not before `p_not_after`, is a bound on the
server's own clock.

Each refused call writes nothing: the head, the journal and the switch equal
their values before.

Every case FAILS UNTIL lane 1's T107 (L1-A6: `commit_write` and
`find_write`) and T114 (L1-A12) land, with lane 2's T227 (`tmpl` holding the
register) and T228 (`lanes_w_fx`). A clone of `tmpl` with no register is
refused by the fixture's own assertion. Without PostgreSQL 16 each skips.

THE MODULE ALSO HOLDS, each at its own section below: T244's test 12 (AT-12)
and section 4.3's rival, and T245's D8 and AT-F34 (phase W, the client's
writers on a real register, through the shim), with T245's texts for 3, which
read the scripts and run with no engine; and T246's AT-F3, a write in doubt at
the deadline (phase W, with its direct calls in phase N); T247's AT-F10, a
pending record against an unrelated identical command (phase W); and T251's
AT-LR006 and AT-F33, two attempts of one write meeting at the commit (phase
N, on these clones).

PHASE W'S WORKSTATION IS T243's: `Estate`, its `estates` fixture, and the
logging tools of T248 are imported from `test_sql_register_order`, as
`test_handoff_skill_80_85` imports its sibling's `Sandbox`, so one
workstation serves both modules and neither keeps a copy.

#
# A COMMIT IN DOUBT (AT-12, ADV-C3; TP:2245-2420), ON T243's WORKSTATION: a
# clone of `tmpl` brought to `primary` by AT-LR006's route, one configuration
# naming it through `lanes_w_fx`, and per writer a `psql` directory holding
# T203's shim, armed by its control file for the writer's FIRST commit call
# only. Commit calls are the requests carrying `commit_write`, lookup tries
# those carrying `find_write`, and the snapshots lane 1's one read-only
# request, `BEGIN ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ READ ONLY` (`lanes-index`'s
# `_query_many`). The oracle never matches on stderr where AT-12 says so: the
# shim's `FATAL` line is one a real loss does not print.
#
# The lookup's timer is D9's `T_L`, `N_a`·`c` + 7 s, 9 s at `c` = 2 (open
# point 37). YS:685 as amended (R-F10-2): where `request-handoff` already
# wrote, its refusal names what it wrote; which of `[tail-sent]`,
# `[tail-done]` and `[no-record]` follow a committed write is NOTES question
# 33, so each asserts the journal's one entry and no `send-keys`.
#
# They FAIL UNTIL lane 1's T107 (L1-A6) and T114 (L1-A12, `journal
# --write-id`), lane 4's attempt loop on primary (L4-B2), its in-doubt rule
# and pending record (L4-B5) and its tail, once (L4-B15) land, with lane 2's
# T227 and T228. Without PostgreSQL 16 each skips.

# ============================================================ PHASE W: D8 and AT-F34 (T245)
#
# THE PENDING RECORD'S RERUN AND THE TAIL, ONCE (AT-D8, TP:3265-3528; AT-F34,
# TP:6941-7036), on T244's workstation and shim. The record is
# `<state>/openRepoTools/register-pending/<d>`, `key=value` lines with one
# `call=<base> <clock> <not_after> <files> <dir>` line per commit call that
# may have committed; its claim files are `<d>.take.<k>`; the done mark is
# `<state>/openRepoTools/register-done/<write_id>`. Every kill is sent on a
# FIFO signal, never after a sleep: the shim's `timer` joined to a FIFO
# blocks once the real `psql` has returned, and the test kills the run's
# process group there, so the row has landed and the writer cannot print.
#
# THE TAKEOVER (Q-L2-6; R26, lane 4's answer to 36): on this host a run that
# takes a killed run's record over waits past that call's `not_after`,
# whether its own snapshot passes or fails, on the record's clock when it
# has none of its own; `[snapshot-fails]` holds it. A record from another
# host keeps "calls at once" (T246's `[too-early]`).
#
# A `tail` RECORD A TAKEOVER CANNOT USE (R-F13c-23; lane 3's batch 8, #165
# 6780753157, Q46, Q34 and text change 1): a takeover of a record holding
# `tail` whose first snapshot has no `found=` refuses 2 and keeps the record,
# giving the effect check and, where the effect is not there, the same command
# with no `LANES_WRITE_ID` once the record is `LANES_REGISTER_PENDING_MAX_AGE_S`
# past its `updated_utc`, printing that time, never `LANES_WRITE_ID=new`
# (Y:5207, Y:5215); a `tail` of neither Y:5179 form is a record that cannot be
# read, T412's 2, the record kept.
#
# `found`'s two lines (R-F13-2, R-F13-7; F13b-OWED items 11 and 15): every
# `found` answer the shim and the fakes give here carries `workstation=` and
# `utc=` after its seq line, as lane 1's T114-fu3 prints them (`found <seq>`,
# `workstation=<name>`, `utc=<epoch s>`, then the `file=` rows), and AT-F34's
# no-record reruns choose Y:5347's text for this host or another by
# `workstation=`, naming the entry's UTC from `utc=`.
#
# THE TAIL'S `gh` CALL IS THE COMMENT (T245c; lane 4's triage, #165
# 6833813092): a case counts only `gh issue comment` and `gh pr comment`
# (`comments`), never `claim`'s Rule 1 reads, which every run of `claim`
# makes before the seam, a killed one and a refused one included.
#
# They FAIL UNTIL L4-B2, L4-B5 and L4-B6 land; `[snapshot-fails]` until lane
# 4's T417 and lane 1's T114 take the record's clock (Q-L1-1); the texts for 3
# until lane 4's T417, T433 and T434; the `tail` record a takeover cannot use
# until lane 4's T418 takes Q46 and Q34; and the `found` lines until lane 1's
# T114 and lane 5's T111 print them. Without PostgreSQL 16 each skips, except
# the texts for 3, which read the scripts and run here.

# ============================================================ PHASE W (and N): AT-F3 (T246)
#
# A WRITE IN DOUBT AT THE DEADLINE (AT-F3, TP:5564-5780). AT-F3's estate is
# test 12's half-open case at `LANES_REGISTER_DEADLINE_S=1` (`HalfOpen`): the
# first commit call lost by `before`; the test's session, as `lanes_w_fx`
# with `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = 0`, replaying that call's script
# without its COMMIT, ended in a `;` that `psql` sends (`without_commit`,
# T244c), so it holds the head row with the row inserted; the
# next snapshot held until the replay returned; and the lookup's first try
# held on a FIFO while the case decides. `<n>` is the first call's
# `not_after`. Its timer is D9's 9 s (open point 37).
#
# AT MOST ONE RETRY (TP:5634-5636): at a 1 s deadline the lost first call
# may end past it, and then no attempt starts and the writer goes straight
# to the lookup, with no next snapshot (T246c; on `pair-m23t` `c8acf67c` the
# shim logged the lookup's two tries after the lost call, and no snapshot).
# So `HalfOpen` waits for the writer's next call after its first commit
# call, that snapshot or the lookup's first try, and releases the snapshot's
# hold only where the snapshot came.
#
# THE TRIES (R26, lane 4's answer to 40): each try starts at least 0.75 s
# after the last one's start, never before the last one has ended, the k-th
# at least k - 1.25 s after the first's, and any up to the window's 10 s
# mark, on the monotonic clock. The 0.75 s and 1.25 s are lane 2's (NOTES
# question 34); the exact spacing is lane 1's virtual-clock check (T114).
# The try endings the shim cannot make (57014, an exit 1, a signal, an exit 3
# with no SQLSTATE, an exit 0 whose answer cannot be read; ERR-50, R-F11-5)
# come from `_ANSWER`, a stand-in put first on `PATH` that answers one
# lookup try as taught and hands every other call on.
#
# TOO EARLY (R26, 36): `[too-early]` takes over a record written on another
# host, so the run has no clock to age and calls at once: LR011's 3, the
# record kept. On this host the takeover waits (T245's `[snapshot-fails]`).
# The killed run's claim names that host, so it counts as live for the
# seam's cap, 120 s, from the later of its `utc` and the record's
# `updated_utc` (Y:5220; pending-record.md §4.3), and the rerun sets the
# cap's test variable, `LANES_REGISTER_SEAM_CAP_S`, to 1 s to take it over
# at once (T246d; lane 4's triage, #165 6833813092).
#
# They FAIL UNTIL L1-A6, L1-A12 and L4-B5 land. Without PostgreSQL 16 each
# skips; the direct calls (LR011 at once, LR008's engine half) are phase N on
# T222's clones.
