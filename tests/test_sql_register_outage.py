"""Feature 007's AT-F7 and AT-F11: the guard under a declared outage and over
a stale mirror (L2-N3; T215; FR-037, FR-056, FR-059)
(opensoft/openRepoTools#165).

The test plan's twelve names, byte for byte. Its case ids: AT-F7's
`[floor|clamp|room]` and AT-F11's `[depth-200|depth-250]`; M11 is
`test_the_register_seq_lookup_is_timed_bounded_beside_the_unbounded_and_grep_forms`.

THE RULE TESTED IS TODAY'S (open point 31; R-B4S): with the database
unreachable the guard refuses 2, and it answers from the mirror only under a
declaration. Those refusals are the prefetch's, form 2's (contract section
3.6): `register read --for guard --prefetch --cache <file> --pid <pid> --repo
<dir> [--lane=<window>]`. The guard's second read, form 4, is noted and never
refused, and no case here reaches it.

THE DECLARATION is always written by lane 1's `lanes-index outage declare`
(T121; L1-A18), in D20's form, `--until <UTC> --why <words>`, with
`--mirror-seq <m>` where the test names `m` (lane 1, #165 comment
6754680212), never by hand. So the declaration side of every case is green
once T121 is in, and the guard side waits for lane 5's T507 (L5-A3, L5-A5).

THE GUARD is driven as T220 drives it (`test_sql_register_bounds.py`):
`bash lanes-edit.sh guard` from a copy of `lanes-edit.sh` beside T203's
flipped `lanes-index` (`flipped_copy`), the hook's JSON on stdin, a live
session record and a stand-in `tmux` in the lane's window (T203c's
`guard_session`), and `LANES_INDEX_CONFIG` naming a `mode=primary`
configuration. Two things are this module's own:

- the lane's checkout is under `$HOME/projects`, so that the guard's scope
  test (`under_projects_root`, clause (e)) lets the prompt through to the
  register read; outside it the guard returns 0 before any read;
- "exits as the mirror's answer gives" is read as: exits as the same guard,
  on the same hook input and the same checkout, exits in files mode
  (`mode=index`, the reference run, with `LANES_NO_FETCH=1` so that it moves
  no ref). The mirror's answer is then today's parser's.

THE SESSION (T203c's `guard_session(home, bin, checkout, session_id=...)`;
T215d): today's guard reads this workstation's session records after its
workspace and tmux checks and before any register read, and refuses 2 where
none is live in its window (lane 5, #165 6755266457: T507's prefetch reads
after that check). So each case that drives the guard in the lane's window
runs with a live record whose session id is the estate's own, `Estate.session`,
the one a register row names (`{session}`), in the window `repoA-2`, and the
stand-in `tmux` it writes to the estate's `bin`; the case's `env()` and
`hook_input()` come from it. The hook's JSON is compact, as the harness sends
it, since the guard's `jstr` reads `"cwd":"<dir>"` with no blank after the
colon. A case that takes the session out of any window (`TMUX=None`) has no
session record at all: AT-P3's `CLAUDE_NO_LANE=1` and `status` cases, as its
text says, and AT-D20's write case. AT-P3's guard refusal runs in the window
with a live record: the guard refuses 2 before any read without one, so only
a lane session reaches the prefetch and the direct read it asserts (lane 3's
T507 ruling (1), #165 6783977598). An estate has no `request`, so
`_end_guard_sessions`, an autouse fixture, ends each session with the test,
as `request.addfinalizer(session.close)` would. The estate's base
environment is `guard_strip_env(os.environ, strip=("T215_",))`, which takes
`PROJECTS_ROOT` and `AGENT_PROTOCOL_ROOT` out beside the lane's, the
harness's, tmux's, libpq's and the fake's variables (F10's items 27, 28).

THE STAND-INS, each first on `PATH`:

- T203's register fake `psql`, which answers `psql --version` itself since
  T203b, behind this module's start logger (`START_PSQL`): the fake's log
  holds no time, so the logger writes each call's start, on the wall clock,
  to `psql-starts.log` beside it, and a `--version` call goes straight on and
  is not logged. The fake is taught to exit 2, as a stopped database does
  (`STOPPED`); the service's socket is absent, since phase 1 has no service;
- a `git` wrapper (`GIT_WRAPPER`) that logs each call's wall-clock start and
  argv. A MIRROR CALL is a `git` call with an argument naming
  `origin/<branch>`: the guard's mirror path reads `origin/$LANES_BRANCH` as
  last fetched (contract section 3.6, "Form C"). This is the module's reading
  of "the `git` wrapper's log shows no mirror call";
- for the real-engine case, a timing wrapper in front of the real `psql`
  (`TIMING_PSQL`), whose watcher logs the call's end even where the client's
  timer kills it.

`Register-Seq` histories are written by `git fast-import` into a bare origin:
a render commit carries the trailer `Register-Seq: <k>`, a handoff commit
none.

Every case fails until L5-A3, L5-A5 and L1-A18 land, and the rollback's head
until lane 3's T304; `test_the_guard_refuses_a_ref_behind_a_rollbacks_head`
and the silent database are real-engine cases on `tests/pgcluster.py`'s `pg`.

    session.

    The guard runs in the lane's window with a live session record (T203c's
    `guard_session`), as this module's other guard cases do. The guard keeps
    its order: with no window, or no session record, it refuses 2 before
    any read, and T507's prefetch comes after the session-record check (B8
    item 40; lane 5, #165 6755266457). So only a lane session reaches the
    prefetch and the direct read this case asserts (lane 3's T507 ruling
    (1), #165 6783977598).

    THE NAME (lane 3's ruling on lane 5's seam question, #165 6809045090):
    under `--for guard`, the cause line names the database as
    `register_url=` gives it, without credentials, not `register_label=`.
    Lane 3 set this oracle exactly (#165 6812459759):
    - the database name is in the added name, the text after "the register
      could not be read (" and before ")" (lane 5's form, `database <db> at
      <host>:<port>`), so the label alone does not do;
    - no password appears anywhere on stderr;
    - no user, `t215_login`, appears in the added name;
    - there is no assert on `psql`'s own cause, which is relayed whole.
    So the cause is asserted in `lanes-index`'s own words, "the register
    could not be read", and no longer by `psql`'s "Connection refused". It
    fails until lane 5's T507A-fix1 (`373d481`, A6), which adds that name."""

# The rollback's cases of D20 (AT-D20 in phase G; L2-N5; B15 tasks:2557,
# "Write the rollback's cases of D20, P3 and AT-F13"): a rollback's start
# declares the outage, writable and read-only, and a rollback rerun declares
# before it goes on, on test 8's estate. TP's AT-D20 "Fixture": "For the
# rollback's cases, test 8's estate, its rollback held at its push by the
# `git` wrapper; once with a writable configuration directory, and once with
# it read-only. For the rerun, the rollback is killed on the shim's FIFO
# signal right after its transaction returns, so no declaration was written."
#
# TEST 8'S ESTATE is copied from `tests/test_sql_register_rollback.py` at DV's
# tip `92fbaf27` (RB's T273b), since the modules share no helper file: its
# `RollbackEstate` (the parts these cases use), its `git` wrapper (here
# `ROLLBACK_GIT_WRAPPER`), `_estate` (here `_rollback_estate`),
# `_held_at_push`, `_open_when_held`, `_said` and `_jsonl`. `unhold` is this
# module's own: the wrapper's hold is taken off before a held call is
# released, so a second call of that subcommand never blocks on a FIFO no
# one opens. Like the rollback module, the estate builds on test 7's cutover
# host, `test_sql_register_import.py`'s `CutoverRegister`, imported when a
# case runs.
#
# Its tests fail until L1-A18, L4-B10, T304 and T326 land (T279's Order),
# and test 8's estate until T327, T321 to T323, T415 and T416, as its
# `prepare()` says.

#: TEST 5'S `git` WRAPPER as test 8 has it (TP:1060-1080): each call is one
#: JSON line of `git-wrapper.log`, its subcommand, its argv, its pid, and
#: `psql_before`, the number of requests the `psql` log named in the control
#: file held when it started. `hold`, `{"call": <subcommand>, "fifo": path}`,
#: blocks that call on the FIFO until the test closes its end.

    rerun"; operations.md 2.3, step 2's "A rerun"), on test 8's estate.

    THE FIRST RUN is killed on the shim's FIFO signal right after its
    transaction returns: the shim's `timer` arm with a FIFO, on step 1's
    call (the first that carries `commit_write`), runs the real `psql` and
    then blocks before it answers; the test kills the rollback there, so it
    never declared. The switch is then at `files`, the marker `removing`,
    and the rollback's own entry, `k+1`, the last seq.

    THE RERUN declares first, with the `git` wrapper holding it at its first
    render call:
    - `[writable]`: the file exists by then, marked as from a rollback, with
      `mirror-seq=<k>` for `k = set_seq - 1`, and no expiry;
    - `[read-only]`: the configuration's directory is read-only, no file is
      written, and the rerun's stdout carries `outage declare --rollback
      --mirror-seq <k>`.
    Then it goes on from the render: released, it ends 0, with no entry of
    its own past `k+1`.

    THE FIRST RENDER CALL is read as the render's `git fetch`: a rerun goes
    on from step 2 (B15 tasks:1033, T304's "A rerun ... declares first, and
    goes on from step 2"), which renders as T322's pass does (T326's step
    2), and that pass fetches first (exit-codes.md section 3.4, `reconcile`'s
    1: "a failed fetch, walk, build or push"). A rerun runs no step 0 or 1,
    so its first `fetch` is the render's.
