"""Feature 007's test 13 and AT-F4: the drill, and the ruleset's order (L2-G5;
AT-13; AT-F4; T276; FR-050, FR-051, FR-059; also US7)
(opensoft/openRepoTools#165).

T276 writes this module: 5 tests, AT-13's 2 and AT-F4's 3 (B15 tasks:2535,
"Write test 13 and AT-F4, the drill and the ruleset's order"). Lane 3's T326
runs it whole: its verify's word `sql_register_drill` selects these five ids
(B15 tasks:1542).

THE ESTATE, `Drill` (the test plan's AT-13, "Fixture"):

- SECTION 5.6'S TLS CLUSTER, T229's `tls_cluster`: a stoppable cluster on
  loopback TCP with TLS 1.3 and SCRAM, and a test CA of its own. The drill's
  database is a database of its own on it, made empty and bootstrapped by P8's
  bootstrap through the admin service with `--label register-drill`, as AT-P8's
  ready environment makes one (`TLSCluster.second_database`). Step 1's
  readiness check needs check 11, which a Unix socket always fails (AT-LRMPG).
- TWO ENGINEERS' LOGINS, `drill_a` and `drill_b`, made after the bootstrap by
  `lanes-index login add <engineer> --admin-service <service>` under a pty
  (operations.md act 3's step 2, "Then the logins"; `Cluster.lanes_index_tty`,
  as T228 makes the fixture's). The passwords each prints once are kept in the
  cluster's memory for its password files, and never printed.
- A BARE ORIGIN WITH THE FIXTURE REGISTER: test 7's, by pgcluster's
  `ImportedRegister` (T227b): AT-7's seed and the operator lane's `log NOTED`
  on top. Its operator checkout, with its W and `workspace.yaml`, is ws1's.
- TWO WORKSTATIONS, ws1 (`Eagle`, the operator lane `repoA-2`, engineer
  `drill_a`) and ws2 (`Hawk`, lane `repoW-1`, engineer `drill_b`, a clone of
  its own), each with its own `$HOME`, `workspace.yaml`, register checkout, W
  and 0600 configuration at `mode=index`. A configuration names only its own
  engineer's two logins and password files, over `sslmode=verify-full` with
  the test CA's root as `sslrootcert=`, with `register_label=register-drill`
  (the cutover takes its label from it, S5) and `register_addresses=1`
  (127.0.0.1 is one address; check 13). Each workstation's installed-tools
  directory holds T203's flipped `lanes-index` (`RENDER_GIT_HALF = True`, so
  `cutover`, `rollback` and a write on primary take `lanes_register` while
  lane 3's T328 has not set the constant), with `lanes-edit.sh`, `lanes`,
  `lane-start` and `repos.tsv` beside it, and check 1's digest list naming
  both tools.
- EACH LANE'S OWN REGISTER CHECKOUT, `<c>` (lane 3's batch g Q119, #165
  6813027223): on primary a write reads its author, its pending hand edits
  and its `repos.tsv` from `<W>-lanes/<lane>`, W being the real path of its
  workstation's `workspace.yaml` `path:`, and refuses 2 where it is not there
  (B15 tasks:1154; lane 4's T415). So each workstation makes its own lane's,
  `repoA-2` on ws1 and `repoW-1` on ws2, a clone of origin, as step 3 flips
  it to `mode=primary`, after the cutover's push and before any write on
  primary (`Workstation.lane_checkout`; T276e).
- THE RULESET'S MODEL (AT-F4; Q21(b), the render set and `lanes/STORE`,
  Brett's "Render set + STORE", comment 6721583757): `RULESET_HOOK`, T271's
  pre-receive hook (test 6) with a switch file the drill's runbook steps set,
  and the renderer's identity let through.
- THE FREEZE (Q4(a)(i)): no other writer runs during steps 2 and 3; the drill
  runs none.

THE ORDER (AT-F4's ruling): the drain's last `PAUSED` write, the ruleset on,
the import at C, the cutover, then the flips; the rollback stops at
`--hold-marker` once the mirror is proved current, the ruleset goes off, and
the rerun pushes the removal of `lanes/STORE`.

WHAT EACH FAILS UNTIL. B15's Order (tasks:2542): it waits for T229, and its
tests fail until L1-A18, T326 and T327 land. Each step's labelled assertion
also names the tasks its own verbs rest on, by their B15 bullets, and lane
4's by lane 4's reading of its own code (#165 6826679959, item 1):
  1. `ready` (T119), the logins (T110) and the TLS cluster (T229);
  2. `import --at` (T115, L1-A13);
  3. `cutover` (T116, L1-A14) and its marker's push, read-back and
     `record_marker` (lane 3's T327); the flips (T120);
  4. a write on primary (lane 4's T415), its render fork (T416) and the
     renderer (lane 3's T321 to T323); `status`'s lag (T117);
  5. `claim` and `log` on primary from both workstations (lane 4's T415),
     each rendered and settled as at step 4 (T416);
  6. a write's 69 (T415); the guard's direct read and its refusal (lane 5's
     T507); the mirror line (lane 5's T505); `status` (T117); `outage
     declare` (T121, L1-A18) and the guard's declared path (T507's SVC-12);
  7. `rollback`'s 69 (T304) and `outage clear` (T121);
  8. `rollback --hold-marker` and its rerun (lane 3's T326), and its
     declaration (T121, T304);
  9. the writer not yet cleared, 69, ended at its snapshot (lane 4's T415);
  10. the rollback's last render (T326).
The drill runs no `commit`, and no step reads the `register seq` text of
`claim`, so lane 4's T420 and T421 are none of its waits (lane 4, #165
6826679959, item 1). Lane 5's T507 is step 6's alone: only `step_6_outage`
calls the guard (lane 5, #165 6826891706).
On line R's `V-round5` (`e8804a4a`), which holds T110, T115, T116, T119, T120,
T121, T304 and T320 to T323 but not T327, T326, T415 or T507, every test stops
at step 3's assertion on the marker: `cutover` exits 0 with the marker
`adding` and nothing pushed (T116's point 1). On lane 3's `T326-m23`
(`552c22d4`), which adds T327 and T326 but not T415, step 3 passes, and a
test that runs step 4 stops there: `lanes-edit.sh` has no SQL write path.
With lane 4's `pair-m23s` (`d949b78`) on it too, step 4 refused 2 where its
lane's `<c>` was not there (line RB15's run e03), which step 3 now makes
(T276e).

READINGS, NOT FOUND IN A CONTRACT:
- "THE RENDERER'S IDENTITY" (AT-F4's fixture): a bare origin on disk cannot
  see D23's deploy key, and a render commit carries the journal's author as
  its committer (D15), so neither tells the renderer apart. The model reads
  the pushing program instead: a push is the renderer's where a process above
  the receiving `git` runs `lanes-index` (the renderer's pass, `cutover`'s
  marker push and `rollback`'s removal, each through T320's one push
  function), and anyone else's otherwise (`lanes-edit.sh`'s files-mode push,
  a person's `git push`). Lane 3 accepted this model, with the check outside
  pytest as its control, and suggested that the hook log the process it
  found, so that a failure names it (#165 6813027223): each record carries
  `found` and `walked`.
- C IS ORIGIN'S TIP AT THE IMPORT, after the freeze's `PAUSED` write and
  AT-F4's accepted pushes: the cutover checks that the tip's `lanes` tree is
  C's (T327's step 2), and the import runs from ws1's checkout fetched to it.
- "THE LAST `PAUSED` WRITE" is the drain's row write, `set-row-state <lane>
  "PAUSED ..."` (lane-handoff's W9), for `repoD-1`, a LIVE row of the fixture
  register that no other step writes, run in files mode from ws2.
- STEP 6'S "THE GUARD ANSWERS FROM THE MIRROR" is the outage module's oracle
  (T215; AT-D20): the `read: mirror at <sha12>` line, the declared line in
  place of the cause, and the exit the same guard gives on the same checkout
  in files mode. The guard runs in the lane's window with a live session
  record (T203c's `guard_session`), the lane's row's session id as its own,
  so it reaches its direct read (lane 3's T507 ruling (1)).
- STEP 6'S REFUSAL names the database as `register_url=` gives it, without
  credentials (lane 3, #165 6809045090 and 6812459759, as the outage module
  holds AT-P3's oracle), and its stderr carries no password.
- WHICH STEPS EACH TEST RUNS: `test_the_drill_import_cutover_outage_rollback_
  and_files_mode_write` runs all ten. `test_a_workstation_not_yet_cleared_
  refuses_after_rollback` runs steps 1 to 4 and 8, then step 9's ws2 half
  with a fuller oracle. AT-F4's three run the order's steps they read: the
  freeze, the import, the cutover and the flips, and, for the two after the
  rollback, step 8; never steps 1, 4, 5, 6 or 7, whose oracles are AT-13's.
  So their rollback starts with the head at the cutover's seq: AT-F4's
  oracle names no write on primary, and its Order (B17 tasks:2544, "Order:
  waits for T229") has its tests fail until L1-A18, T326 and T327 alone,
  where step 4's write would also need lane 4's T415 and T416 (T276d,
  after line DR15's run on T326-m23 met T415's placeholder there).
- OPEN POINT 8'S POLL READS A FETCHED W: `status` reads `m` on W's
  `origin/main` as last fetched and never fetches (tasks:545), and no write
  on primary fetches W (D12), while the render pushes from the lane's `<c>`.
  So `wait_lag_0` fetches ws1's W with plain git before each poll (lane 3's
  ruling (a), #165 6833830078), as the drill's act, not a write's.
- STEP 10'S "EVERY OBJECT HAS AT MOST ONE HOLDER" is read for the objects the
  drill claims, across SQL's live holds and origin's logs, as T273b's
  `_claim_holders` reads one.

HELPERS COPIED, NEVER SHARED (a module's own): `_rows`, `_renders`,
`RENDER_SET`, `REGISTER_SEQ` and `LAG_0` from `test_sql_register_import.py`
(T211's and T272's, in this base); `CHECK_LINE` and `_checks` from
`test_sql_register_operator_tools.py` (T218); the hook's path rule and its
`changed` from T271's `GATE_HOOK` (`test_sql_register_divergence.py`, line
DV's `92fbaf27`); the guard's run, `_label` and the files-mode reference from
T215's outage module (line W4a); `MIRROR_LINE` from the readers module (line
N1); the holders' rule from T273b's `_claim_holders` (line RB); `_masked` from
`tests/pgcluster.py`. From the fixture and H's helpers, which each real-engine
module imports: `tls_cluster`, `ImportedRegister`, `PASSWORD_LINE`,
`ClusterError`, `flipped_copy`, `guard_session` and `guard_strip_env`.

THE PATH (wave 11's policy, mask and never drop): no call here drops a `PATH`
directory. Each workstation puts its fake `tmux`, its tools and the engine's
binaries first and keeps every inherited directory behind them, so its `psql`
is the server's and its `lanes-index` its own copy; nothing is masked.

Every wait here has a ceiling: each poll, `SETTLE_S`; each command, its
`timeout`; the guard, its 5 s kill. Every id is RE: it asks for the TLS
cluster, and without PostgreSQL 16 it skips with T205's banner.
