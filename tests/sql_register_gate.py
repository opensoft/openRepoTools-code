"""THE LANDING GATE'S READER (T280; Brett's "Temporary landing gate
(Recommended)", 2026-11-13; FR-059). TEMPORARY: T281 removes it in the last
set, T328's, with the hook in `tests/conftest.py`, the marker directory,
`tests/test_sql_register_gate.py`, its `repo_hygiene` row and every module's
table, and the whole suite then runs ungated.

Every 007 code pull request passes full CI, and 007's tests land before the
code they test. So from the first set until the last, a 007 test whose tasks
have not all landed is SKIPPED, and the skip names the tasks it waits for:
"waits for T415, T416".

THE TABLES. A 007 test module carries its own table, `SQL_REGISTER_GATE_TABLE`,
written from its task's **Order** and lane 2's per-id verdict rows, in that
task's own files. A key is one of:

  * `"*"`, the tasks every id of the module waits for;
  * a test function's name, for every id of that function;
  * one id with its parameters, `name[param]`, which replaces the function's
    row for that one id.

Each value is a tuple of 007 task ids. An id waits for the union of the
module's `"*"` row and its own row. An id that no table names runs, and so does
every id of a module with no table. This module adds no table of its own.

THE MARKERS. `tests/sql_register_landed/<Txxx>` is one empty file for each
landed task. Each code PR adds its tasks' markers at its cut, outside every
task's `files:`, and that one change turns the set's own tests on in its own
full CI. Git keeps no empty directory, so before the first set's cut there is
no directory, and a missing directory is read as "no task has landed".

007'S TASK IDS. The code leg holds no `tasks.md`, so the ids are carried here,
as `TASK_IDS`: tasks.md's task lines at `SPEC_COMMIT`. A table or a marker that
names anything else FAILS THE RUN, gated or not, so a bad row fails a local run
too. A task added to tasks.md later is added to `TASK_IDS` by the first code
PR whose table or marker names it.

WHEN THE GATE IS ACTIVE (lane 3's rulings, 2026-11-13 and 2026-11-14). Only in
a GitHub Actions run (`GITHUB_ACTIONS=true`) whose workflow is not `verify` and
whose ref is not a `verify/` branch. The ref is `GITHUB_HEAD_REF` on a
`pull_request` or `pull_request_target` event, whose `GITHUB_REF_NAME` is
`<number>/merge`, and `GITHUB_REF_NAME` on any other event. That covers each
pull request's CI, `main`'s CI and the merge queue's runs. Local runs, line R's
census, every `verify/` branch and every run of `verify.yml` run ungated: those
branches are cut from line R, which holds no markers, and a dispatched verify
run may be on any ref (`GITHUB_WORKFLOW` is `verify`), so no verify passes by
the gate's skip. `SQL_REGISTER_GATE=on` or `=off` overrides that either way,
and any other value of it is refused. Nothing under `.github/` sets it, nor
does `tests/run.sh`, as a `repo_hygiene` row holds.

The gate decides by landing state alone. With `OPENREPOTOOLS_REQUIRE_PG=1`, a
missing engine still refuses the run in `pgcluster.py`'s `pytest_configure`,
before any test is collected, so the gate's skip cannot hide one. Nor does
the reason carry pgcluster's "real PostgreSQL 16", so its banner never counts
a gated id as an engine skip.

Python 3.9 or later, standard library only. `tests/conftest.py` calls `gate()`
from its `pytest_collection_modifyitems`, after `-k` has deselected.
