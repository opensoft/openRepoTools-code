"""Feature 007's test 6, a stray commit and its two ways out, with AT-MIR's
gating case and the model of the server-side gate (L2-G2; L2-G5's AT-MIR
gating case; AT-6; AT-MIR; T271; FR-047, FR-048, FR-059; US6)
(opensoft/openRepoTools#165).

T271 writes this module: 11 tests, 10 from AT-6 (9) and AT-MIR (1), and one
new since v3f, R-F10-34's, which holds lane 3's two strays for T324,
R-F13c-10's third id and, new in B15, lane 3's L2-8 fourth,
`[stray-no-longer-applies]`. Lane 3's T324 runs the whole module by its
word, `sql_register_divergence`.

THE V1.1.0 WRITER (PC-12; the test plan's open point 5).
`tests/fixtures/lanes-edit-v1.1.0/lanes-edit.sh` is `lanes-edit.sh` byte for
byte as code `2a057a6d` (tag `v1.1.0`) holds it: blob `d28ed8f2`, 1139720
bytes. CI checks out at depth 1 with no tags, so the copy is the only way the
suite runs the real old writer. Its digest is recorded twice: in
`tests/fixtures/lanes-edit-v1.1.0/SHA256SUMS`, in `sha256sum`'s form, and in
this module's `V110_SHA256`, beside its git blob id and size. Every case that
runs it calls `v1_1_0_writer()` first, which checks all four, so a drift in
the fixture fails loudly instead of testing something else (AT-6,
"Flakiness"). The copy is never run from its own directory's neighbours: no
`lanes-index` and no `repos.tsv` sit beside it, and the stale clone's `PATH`
masks `lanes-index`, so it makes no index nudge.

THE ESTATE (AT-6, "Fixture"), `Estate`, built inside each case so that a
step a lane has not built fails the case at its own assertion:

- the fixture register at C: a files-mode workspace on a bare origin
  (`Workspace`), its seed `SEED`, and a files-mode `log NOTED` on top as the
  operator lane, so C's tip is bytes `lanes-edit.sh` wrote, as test 7's
  fixture register is built;
- imported on `pg` by `lanes-index import --at <C>` (lane 1's T115), as the
  operator lane through its checkout;
- the cutover by AT-LR006's route (TP:4610-4615): `commit_write` with a
  `cutover` entry, as REGISTER-WRITER, then the marker commit, `lanes/STORE`
  with D21's fields and `Register-Seq: 1`, pushed to the bare origin as a
  fast-forward of C, then `record_marker`, so the switch reads `primary`
  with the marker `present`. Neither T116 nor T327 is in T271's Order, so the
  estate runs neither `cutover` nor its push;
- each primary write is a `commit_write` call of a `write` entry, as
  REGISTER-WRITER (AT-LR006's "one write"), that appends a line of no kind to
  `lanes/LANES.md`, so it carries no structured row; and each render a fork
  would start is `lanes-index render --checkout <c>` run by the case, as a
  fork runs it (TP:1160-1167), in the operator lane's checkout. Lane 4's
  writes on primary and their fork (T415, T416) are not in T271's Order.

The commands run from the operator lane's checkout, `LANES_LANE=repoA-2`, by
T203's flipped copy of `lanes-index` (`RENDER_GIT_HALF = True`), which the
renderer and the two ways out need on `lanes_register`; `import --at` runs the
shipped `lanes-index`, as test 7's does. Their configuration names the
session cluster's socket as its superuser, as test 7's does.

THE STALE WORKSTATION (AT-6, "Fixture"), `StaleWorkstation`: a clone of
origin with a home, a workspace pointer and a lane of its own (`repoW-1`), no
`lanes-index` configuration, and the v1.1.0 writer. Its `log NOTED` pushes a
commit changing `lanes/log/repoW-1.md`; it knows no marker.

THE WAITS (open point 8). The stop is read after the renderer's exit: the
case runs the render itself, in the foreground, so its exit is the wait.
Where the lag must reach 0, the case polls `lanes-index status` every 100 ms
until it prints a lag of 0, with a 30 s ceiling, after a render of its own;
a render a way out forks itself is the same render lock's, so the case's own
render then marks a rerun and the poll waits for both.

THE GATE MODEL (AT-6, "Options", Q21(b)): `GATE_HOOK`, a pre-receive hook in
the bare origin, refuses a push whose commits change a path of the render
set or `lanes/STORE` (`lanes/LANES.md`, `lanes/log/<lane>.md`,
`lanes/aliases.tsv`, anything under `lanes/archive/`, and `lanes/STORE`), and
lets every other path through, `lanes/repos.tsv` and `lanes/log/README.md`
among them. It is a model: the suite cannot reach GitHub. Its two tests need
no engine.

WHAT EACH FAILS UNTIL (T271's Order, B15 tasks:2487): it waits for T205,
and its tests fail until L1-A6, L1-A15, T322, T324 and T326 land. Case by
case: the estate needs lane 1's T107 (`commit_write`, `record_marker`,
`record_mirror_state`; L1-A6) and T115 (`import --at`, L1-A13), and each
case reads `status` (T117, L1-A15) and runs the renderer's pass (lane 3's
T321 to T323). Then:

- the stop, the row's two ids and the three commits outside the render set
  fail until those alone;
- `test_status_prints_diverged_at_the_stray_sha_and_reconcile_imports_nothing`
  also fails until T325, whose re-render gives `reconcile` the renderer's 1
  for a recorded `diverged at`, where T117's check alone, like `--dry-run`,
  exits 0 (lane 3, #165 6809045090, L2-6);
- the two ways out, the strays and the `Register-Seq` above the head fail
  until T324 too;
- `test_rollback_works_after_each_way_out` and the `Register-Seq` case's last
  part fail until T326 (the rollback's render and push);
- `[stray-revives-a-pair]` fails until T324's refusal and T107's
  `one_live_claim`; `[stray-no-longer-applies]` also fails until T324's
  `import --single` refusal (lane 3, #165 6809045090, L2-8); the other two
  strays' oracle needs T115's `import --at`;
- the gate model's seven ids wait for nothing: they test the model and the
  pinned copy, and pass now.

COPIED, NOT SHARED (lane 2's rule for wave 12: no module imports another's
helpers). From `test_sql_register_import.py` (line W3a at T211m, `c9989b5`):
`Workspace`, the fixture register's `config` and `import_at`,
`flipped_indexer`, `_rows`, `_renders`, `RENDER_SET`, `REGISTER_SEQ` and
`LAG_0`. From `test_sql_register_landing_expired.py` (line LX at T253e,
`e9b949e`): `_masked_path`, with its mirrors. From
`test_sql_register_schema.py` (line W3b at T221j, `0154c91`): `STRUCTURED`
and `structured`, T221's step-6 comparison, and the commit call's form. From
`test_sql_register_rollback.py` (line RB at T273b, `35b616ff`): test 8's first
oracle, `_assert_rolled_back`, and `_said`.

READINGS, NOT FOUND IN A CONTRACT:

- "A later primary write still commits to SQL" is a `commit_write` of a
  `write` entry that returns the next seq while `diverged at` is recorded.
- "SQL writes refused", in test 8's first oracle, is `commit_write`'s LR002
  for a `write` entry once the switch reads `files`, with the head unmoved.
- "Its line edits equal the stray commit's diff": the v1.1.0 writer's stray
  appends lines to one log, so the entry's edits are one `append` per added
  line, in order, on that path.
- A revert's message "names" the stray where it holds the stray's first 7
  hex digits, git's shortest abbreviation, or more; its `git_commit` is the
  full sha (design.md's kinds paragraph).
- "Its render commit puts SQL's state back over the stray" is read over the
  render commits that follow the stray up to the revert's seq: a write that
  lands between the stray and the revert is rendered first and already puts
  the stray's path back (design.md's prototype note on the import), so on
  each path the stray changed, the tip after the resume equals the stray's
  parent.
- "The pending seqs reach origin in order": the `Register-Seq` values of the
  commits after the stray, oldest first, are each seq from `m+1` to the head,
  once each.
- "Between renders": the `repos.tsv` and `handoffs/` commits land after a
  render of their own estate's first write; the cutover's `lanes/STORE`
  commit is origin's tip when the first render starts.
- The negative and the row-only cases' "status shows no divergence" is
  `status`'s `divergence:  none recorded` line, where the row is empty.
- `[stray-revives-a-pair]`'s "writes nothing" also leaves `mirror_state`
  recording the stray.
- `[stray-no-longer-applies]`'s "a primary write changes a line after the
  stray commit changed it": the stray retitles `lanes/LANES.md`'s first
  line, its heading, a line of no kind, by hand; then a `commit_write` of a
  `write` entry replaces the same line in SQL with other text, by its old
  text's digest. So the stray's one edit, a `replace` at line 1, finds there
  a line its parent never held.
- Its "sends no commit call" is read through a `psql` first on the import's
  `PATH` that logs each call's stdin, where `lanes-index` sends each request:
  no request holds `commit_write(`, and at least one was sent, since the
  refusal reads SQL's images. Its "naming the edit" is stderr naming the
  edit's path and that its edits "no longer apply" (TP:1292). Its "writes
  nothing" is the head, the journal's count, the four structured tables and
  SQL's images as they were, `mirror_state` still recording the stray, and
  origin's tip still the stray.
- The ways out run "on a person's word from the operator lane's checkout"
  (TP:1276-1277), where that person's git names an author: the checkout's
  own `user.name` and `user.email` name `AUTHOR`, set once C is made. A way
  out removes every inherited `GIT_*` variable before it asks git (D12), so
  the module's `GIT_AUTHOR_*` variables, which still sign the estate's own
  commits, cannot name it; T324 as built refuses with 2 where git names no
  author there.
- The stale clone's `sleep` is a stub that returns at once, so the v1.1.0
  writer's six push attempts, three seconds apart, take no time; what it
  does at each attempt is unchanged.

RULED BY LANE 3 (#165 6809045090; its RULINGS-batch-e-analysis-20261111.md,
L2-6 to L2-8; B15 folds them):

- L2-6: AT-6's stop stands (TP:1285): `reconcile` exits non-zero on a
  diverged mirror once T325 lands. T325 re-renders what the mirror lacks
  through T322's pass, and the pass's recorded stop, `diverged at` among
  them, is the renderer's 1 (exit-codes.md section 3.4's `reconcile` 1
  row). T117's check alone, like `reconcile --dry-run`, exits 0 whatever it
  found. So the status case asserts 1, the code the contract names, and
  fails until T325.
- L2-7: T117 is right. With `m` above the head there is no lag (Y:2850):
  until a revert names `R`, its `Register-Seq` counts, so `m` = `h`+10 is
  past `n` = `h`+1, and `status` prints the lag as "none, and the mirror's
  <m> is past n <n>" (TP:1319 at B15: "no lag: its `m` is past `n`
  (Y:2850), as `status` says"). The `Register-Seq` case asserts that line,
  naming `h`+10 and `h`+1. The plain stray's "a lag of at least 1"
  (TP:1284) stands: that stray carries no `Register-Seq`.
- L2-8: AT-6's "case of its own", the import's refusal where the stray's
  edits no longer apply to SQL's images (TP:1292-1293), is
  `[stray-no-longer-applies]`, a fourth id of the strays' function beside
  `[stray-revives-a-pair]`, whose LR005 is the other refusal: `import
  --single` refuses with 2 before any commit call, naming `render --revert
  <sha>` as the way out (PC-4; T324 `9a664ef`:16115-16117), writes nothing,
  and leaves the tables unchanged (B15 tasks:2486). It fails until T324's
  refusal.

    that revives a pair (R-F13c-10; lane 3's batch 5, #165 6778890211): a
    person's stray commit on origin's `lanes`; the next write's render stops
    `diverged at <sha>`.

    `[stray-deletes-a-row]` and `[stray-inserts-before-the-end]`: `lanes-index
    import --single <sha>` loads it through `register commit` and exits 0;
    the renderer resumes and `reconcile` passes; and the four structured
    tables equal what `import --at` of the same mirror leaves in a second
    clone's database, compared as T221's step-6 cases compare them, without
    the columns a write stamps, which ERR-48's re-stamped later lines are.
    The insert's holds below its line each point at their own line.

    `[stray-revives-a-pair]`: two claims on one object are live after it,
    neither `exempt`, since only an import sets `exempt`; `import --single`
    refuses with 2, LR005 `one-live-claim` and `held-by=`, writes nothing,
    and leaves the four tables as they were. Its way out is the revert,
    which `test_the_renderers_revert_resumes_it_and_reconcile_passes` covers.

    `[stray-no-longer-applies]` (lane 3, #165 6809045090, L2-8; AT-6,
    TP:1292-1293; B15 tasks:2486): a primary write changes a line after the
    stray commit changed it, so the stray's edits no longer apply to SQL's
    images; `import --single` refuses with 2, naming the edit and `render
    --revert <sha>` as the way out (PC-4), sends no commit call, writes
    nothing, and leaves the four tables as they were.
