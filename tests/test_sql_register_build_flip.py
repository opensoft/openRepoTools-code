"""TEST 14: THE BUILD BEFORE THE RENDERER'S GIT HALF (feature 007; the test
plan's AT-14; FR-001, FR-002, FR-003, FR-059).

One constant is the flip: `RENDER_GIT_HALF`, beside `SCHEMA_VERSION` in the
checkout's `lanes-index` (lane 1's T105, L1-A3). While it is False, Q6(c)'s
refusal of `mode=primary` is built in, and lane 3's T328 is the only change
that sets it True. So the module builds both states from the one checkout,
with T203's `flipped_copy` (PC-5): the REFUSING copy has the constant False,
the FLIPPED copy has it True, whichever way the checkout's own says.

WHAT IT HOLDS, by task:

  * T212 (L2-N2), the refusing state:
    - `test_mode_primary_is_refused_until_the_git_half_and_goes_to_sql_once_
      flipped[refusing]`: `lanes-index mode` exits 78 with the fixed text and
      nothing on stdout, and so does it over `store=sqlite` or no
      `register_url=`, since Q6(c)'s check runs first (Y:4849; lane 1, #165
      6747929926 point 1); every other command this build has that reads the
      configuration exits 2 with the same text: `status`, `sync` and
      `reconcile` with `LANES_INDEX` unset, and `export`, which writes it to
      `<out>/why`; `cutover --import <sha>`, `rollback` and `set-mode
      primary` exit 2 with it too, once a build has them (TP:2598-2600). No
      `psql` runs, no store is made, and the files, the HEAD and origin are
      unchanged;
    - `[mode-under-index-off]`: with `LANES_INDEX=off` kept set over the same
      file, `lanes-index mode` still exits 78 with the text, never `index`
      (lane 3, #165 6747957479; lane 1, 6748099727). Its `[J3]` word is
      `sql_register_build_flip and mode-under-index-off`;
    - `test_lanes_edit_asks_lanes_index_mode_only_where_a_configuration_
      exists` (D3): with no configuration file and `LANES_INDEX_CONFIG`
      unset, a logging stand-in at `lanes-index`'s path records no call, and
      the verb writes in files mode;
    - `test_mode_primary_with_sqlite_is_refused` (P162-163; R-F9-5): on T203's
      FLIPPED copy, where Q6(c)'s refusal is lifted, `mode=primary` with
      `store=sqlite`, or with no `register_url=`, is T104's refusal, 2 (lane
      1's L1v4.10:117), and not Q6(c)'s text. On the refusing copy Q6(c)'s 78
      comes first, which `[refusing]` holds. This is lane 2's reading of the
      two lines together (NOTES question 29);
    - `test_register_read_exits_78_under_the_refusal[readers|for-guard]`:
      `register read` exits 78 with the text, never 2, in the readers' forms
      (contract section 3.6's forms 1 and 3) and in `--for guard`'s (forms 2
      and 4), as contract section 2.7's 78 row names them;
    - `test_readers_under_the_refusal_answer_the_78_as_a_failed_read[<read>|
      listing|session-start|guard|projection]`: run from the same estate under
      the refusal, with the fake `psql`'s log empty, a read that decides
      exits 69 with nothing on stdout; the listings and the `SessionStart`
      block answer from the mirror, exit 0, and carry the `read: mirror`
      line; the prompt guard exits 2, run in the lane's window with a live
      session record and compact hook JSON, since without them it refuses 2
      before any read (lane 3's T507 ruling (1), #165 6783977598); and
      `managed-projection` answers 1, UNKNOWN, never 8.
  * T256 (L2-W6), the flipped state and the render fork's stub test, each a
    REAL-ENGINE case (the flipped state is RE: its write is a `register
    snapshot` reply and a commit, which a fake cannot fabricate), and
    `[replay-keeps-pid]`, which needs no engine:
    - `[flipped]`: on the FLIPPED copy, with `register_url=` on the session
      cluster's socket, on an imported register after the cutover, the same
      `log NOTED` exits 0, the journal gains one entry, the shim's log holds
      one attempt of two calls (the snapshot and the commit, sent as
      `register_url=`'s login with `register_passfile=` and no `PGPASSWORD`),
      the files are unchanged, since there is no git half in this build, and
      the stand-in logs one `mode` call, the primary half of the rule that
      the ask is made once: the parent asks it, and the attempt's child asks
      none (Y:5038, Y:5452);
    - `[replay-keeps-pid]` (R-T409-9; lane 3, #165 6747281902, T409's item
      9; lane 3's proposal, 6852014823, which lane 2 confirmed in
      6858869119): with a configuration, an unrouted write whose first push
      loses a race runs again by S4's replay, an `exec` that keeps the pid,
      and the stand-in logs one `mode` call across it (Y:4858, Y:5121: the
      ask is made once). It runs in `index` mode, with no engine, since no
      primary writer that asks the mode ever replays. Its `[J3]` word is
      `sql_register_build_flip and replay-keeps-pid`;
    - `test_a_primary_write_forks_render_checkout_on_the_lane_checkout_
      detached[plain|no-fetch-set|index-off-set]`: after a primary write
      commits, the stand-in's log holds one `render` call, `render --checkout
      <c>`, `<c>` the writing lane's checkout, `<W>-lanes/<lane>/`; its
      environment has no `LANES_NO_FETCH`, though the verb ran with it set in
      `[no-fetch-set]` (D12); it is made though `LANES_INDEX=off` is set in
      `[index-off-set]`; its stdin is closed or `/dev/null` and its
      descriptors 3 to 9 are closed, as `index_nudge`'s fork has them; and
      the writer exits with the verb's own code while the stand-in holds the
      `render` call on a FIFO, so no fork waits, and the flipped copy's
      answer to it, "git half not installed", is never read.
  * T277 (L2-G6), test 14 kept after group C:
    `test_the_refusal_constant_is_true_exactly_when_render_checkout_exists`
    reads `RENDER_GIT_HALF` from the checkout's source, and asks the same
    copy whether it knows `render --checkout`: a build that lacks a verb
    answers it 64, before it reads an argument (lane 1's T105: "the 64 is
    what F8 reads from a `lanes-index` too old to have a verb"). It fails
    between T321 and T328, while `render --checkout` exists and the constant
    is still False, and T328's `verify:` runs it. T203's `flipped_copy` takes
    the constant either way, so the refusing state still builds once T328
    sets it, and T277 adds no helper code (R1's N5).

THE CODES ARE READ FROM THE CONSTANTS (contracts/exit-codes.md section 1:
"the tests read the constant, never a literal"): `EXIT_CONFIG` and
`EXIT_REFUSED`, which T105 names in `lanes-index`. A code `lanes-edit.sh`
exits with (69, 1 and 2 from the readers) has no constant, and is a literal.

THE REFUSING STATE'S CONFIGURATION (T212's bullet; lane 1's CLI4.5 section
2.5; R09): `mode=primary`, with `register_url=` and `reader_url=` on
`db.invalid`, each carrying `sslmode=verify-full` and an `sslrootcert=` that
names a test root file, and 0600 password files. That meets the block's
configuration rule, and Q6(c)'s 78 does not rest on it: Q6(c) runs before
T104's R8, R9, R10 and R15, so test 14's own state, a register URL on
`db.invalid` with no TLS, gives the same 78 (R-F9-5).

THE FAKE-`psql` HOST RULE (L1v4.5:525; lane 1, #165 6741670709 item 9): the
refusing state's `register_url=`, on `db.invalid`, meets it by `verify-full`
and a root file, and every other configuration here either names no URL or
carries the same `verify-full` and root file, since T104 refuses any other at
load (CLI4.5 section 2.5). The fake is T203's `REGISTER_FAKE_PSQL`, first on
`PATH`; its log stays empty in every case here, since nothing connects.

`LANES_INDEX` (R-F9-5): `tests/conftest.py` sets `LANES_INDEX=off` for the
whole run, and `Estate` builds its environment without it. Under it `sync`
and `reconcile` keep #160's no-op exit 0, even over a `mode=primary` file, so
`[refusing]` runs them with it unset; `lanes-index mode` reads the
configuration whatever it says, which `[mode-under-index-off]` holds.

THE STAND-IN AT `lanes-index`'S PATH. The checkout's `lanes-edit.sh` finds
`lanes-index` beside itself (`$SCRIPT_DIR/lanes-index`, then `PATH`), so each
`lanes-edit.sh` case runs a copy of it, with what it reads beside it, and puts
`LOGGING_WRAPPER` at `lanes-index`'s path there: it logs each call, then runs
the `lanes-index` it stands in front of. A reader case first asserts that the
reader asked `lanes-index`, so a case that never reaches the refusal fails on
that, never vacuously (`session-start` excepted, as T217's mirror test does).

NO NETWORK. Every remote is a bare repository under `tmp_path`, `$HOME` is
temporary, and `db.invalid` is never resolved: in the refusing state nothing
connects.

THE REAL ENGINE, for T256's flipped state and render fork only. The flipped
state takes `pg` from `tests/pgcluster.py`, one database cloned from the
session's template, and so skips with T205's banner where no PostgreSQL 16 is
found, unless `OPENREPOTOOLS_REQUIRE_PG=1`. The render fork's test asks for
`pg` itself, so its fixture closure holds `pg_engine` (T200's rule).
`[flipped]` shares its function with the refusing state and with
`[replay-keeps-pid]`, which need no engine and always run (AT-14: "The
refusing state is FP"), so it takes `pg` by `request.getfixturevalue` and
skips alone. Its register is reached as
AT-LR006's fixture reaches one (TP:4610-4615), by the documented functions as
`lanes_register_writer`: `commit_write` with an `import` entry holding the
estate's render set, then a `cutover` entry, then `record_marker`, as T221's
module does; the template is T227's, built by `lanes-index bootstrap
--no-passwords`. Two logins join the writer and the reader groups and connect
by the cluster's trust. The shim (T203's `PSQL_SHIM`, unarmed) stands in front
of the cluster's own `psql` and logs every call. Each flipped estate also has
the writing lane's own register checkout `<c>`, `<W>-lanes/<lane>/`, a clone
of W's origin, as lane 2's writes module makes one (`make_lane_checkout`): on
primary a write makes no clone, since a clone is a fetch (D12), so lane 4's
T415 refuses a write whose lane has none (`pw_checkout`; tasks:1154-1155).

`[replay-keeps-pid]`'S ESTATE (lane 3's proposal, 6852014823; lane 2's build
notes, 6858869119). No primary writer that asks the mode replays: on primary
T415's arm runs `pw_run` before 1a's routing (R17), and the attempt's child
asks nothing and stops at the seam before any push (Y:5038, Y:5040, Y:5042).
So the case runs in `index` mode, which `lanes-index mode` answers from the
file alone: a 0600 `mode=index` file named by `LANES_INDEX_CONFIG`, with
`LANES_INDEX=off`, which skips the index's nudge and never the mode question
(Y:5718), and the logging stand-in in front of the checkout's `lanes-index`.
The write is unrouted, through `Estate`'s explicit `LANES_REPO`, so it has no
`LANES__PID` and its replay keeps the mode only by `LANES__REPLAY_PID`, which is
R-T409-9's half. Its first push loses a race: `tests/a23_box.py`'s `NET_GIT`
is `LANES_GIT`, and its `FAKE_NET_HOOK` lands one commit of a peer, a clone of
the estate's origin, before the first push only, as
`tests/test_a23_publish_replay.py`'s `Box.race` does. With no race there is no
`push refused` note, and with no stand-in found there is no `mode` call, so
the case cannot pass vacuously.

WHAT EACH WAITS FOR (the block's Order): T212's tests fail until L1-A3, L1-A4,
L1-A11 and L5-A5 land: lane 1's T105 (the constant and `mode`), T113
(`register read`) and lane 5's T504 (the read door). D3's test passes at once
on a build that never asks the mode. T256's real-engine cases fail until L4-B1
and L4-B13 land, and on an engine they also need T227's template and lane 1's
T107 functions. `[replay-keeps-pid]` fails until lane 4's T409 follow-up for
its item 9, and needs Amendment 23's S4 replay and `NET_GIT`. T277's test
needs T105's constant, and fails between T321 and T328.
