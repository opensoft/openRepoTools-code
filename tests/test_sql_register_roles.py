"""Test R, the register's roles: each refused outside its scope (#165, L2-N4).

THE TEST PLAN'S AT-R, ITS SEVEN TESTS, on a real PostgreSQL 16 (phase N, RE: a
fake `psql` cannot enforce a GRANT). The roles are design.md §1.4's:

  * `lanes_register_owner`, which owns `lanes_register` and its functions;
  * REGISTER-WRITER, `lanes_register_writer`, and READER,
    `lanes_register_reader`: groups that cannot log in. Each engineer holds
    them through a writer login and a reader login of their own, and the dump
    job through `lanes_register_dump`, a member of READER alone;
  * the indexer's login, `lanes_indexer`, which owns `lanes_index`.

THE FIXTURE'S LOGINS are section 3.1's: `lanes-index login add fx` and `login
add --dump-job` make `lanes_w_fx`, `lanes_r_fx` and `lanes_register_dump`
once per session (T228), on the session cluster whose template the bootstrap
built (T227). The socket trusts every role, so a test connects by name with
`psql -U <login>` and no password: what is tested is authorization, not
authentication (open point 6). Each group's row of the matrix is read through
its logins, since a group cannot log in.

THE EXPECTED MATRIX is §1.4's GRANT block and its table of roles, written
below by hand, never read from the bootstrap's output, so the test does not
check the bootstrap against itself:

  * REGISTER-WRITER: SELECT on `lanes_register`'s tables and views; EXECUTE
    on `commit_write`, `switch_to_files`, `record_marker`, `find_write` (its
    six-argument form), `record_mirror_state` and `render_file`; no EXECUTE on
    the five scope functions or any other; no INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE
    or CREATE anywhere; no SELECT on a sequence; nothing in `lanes_index`;
  * READER: SELECT on both schemas' tables, views and sequences; EXECUTE on
    `render_file` only; nothing else;
  * the indexer: everything in `lanes_index`, which it owns, and nothing in
    `lanes_register`.

THE OBJECTS are read from the catalog as the superuser: each table, view and
sequence of both schemas, each function of `lanes_register`, and each schema.
The bootstrap leaves `lanes_index` empty, so the matrix's test first makes one
table there AS THE INDEXER, `t216_indexed`, with an identity column: the
reader's default privileges then have a table and a sequence to be checked
on. It lives in the test's own database.

HOW A STATEMENT IS TRIED: one `psql` session per login, with
`VERBOSITY=sqlstate` and `ON_ERROR_STOP` off. Each probe runs as
`BEGIN READ WRITE; <probe>; \\echo R <n> :SQLSTATE` and `ROLLBACK;`, so a
READER's read-only default (25006) never stands in for a refusal (42501), and
nothing a probe does survives it. An allowed probe gives `00000`, a refused
one `42501`, and nothing else passes. The probes touch no row:

  * a relation: `SELECT count(*) … WHERE false`; on a table, and on a view
    that `information_schema.views` reports insertable or updatable,
    `INSERT INTO t (c) SELECT c FROM t WHERE false`, `UPDATE t SET c = c WHERE
    false` and `DELETE FROM t WHERE false`, with `c` a column that is neither
    generated nor an identity `ALWAYS` (either fails with 428C9 before any
    privilege is checked); `TRUNCATE` on a table only, since a view or a
    sequence fails with 42809 first; so no write to `main_slots`, whose window
    function makes a write fail with 55000 first;
  * a sequence: `SELECT count(*) FROM s WHERE false` and `SELECT nextval(…)`;
  * a function: `SELECT f((SELECT NULL::<type>), …) WHERE false`. EXECUTE is
    checked when the expression is initialised, so `WHERE false` keeps an
    allowed call from running. Each argument is a sub-select, not a NULL
    constant: the planner folds a STRICT function called with a constant NULL
    to NULL, and its EXECUTE would never be checked;
  * a schema: `CREATE TABLE <schema>.t216_probe (x integer)`.

Every test here FAILS UNTIL lane 1's T107 and T109 (L1-A6, L1-A7: the schema,
the roles and their GRANTs), T110 (L1-A8: `lanes-index login`) and lane 2's
T227 and T228 (the template and the fixture's logins) land: until then a login
or a group does not exist, and each test says so by an assertion. Without
PostgreSQL 16 each skips, as `tests/pgcluster.py` says.
