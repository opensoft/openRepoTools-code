"""Feature 007's test D9, the timeouts table, its phase-N rows (AT-D9, L2-N5;
section 4.4; T220), and lane 1's T106 case (R-F9-3)
(opensoft/openRepoTools#165).

LANE 1'S T106 ALONE, `test_postgres_store_register_roles_connect_by_their_own_
url_with_one_joined_request` (R-F9-3; lane 1, #165 6752661856), needs no
engine. It loads `lanes-index` in process, as `test_lanes_index.py`'s
`load_indexer` does, puts T203's register fake `psql` first on `PATH`, which
answers `psql --version` itself (T203b), sets an inherited `PGHOSTADDR`,
`PGSSLMODE=disable`, `PGOPTIONS` and `PGTARGETSESSIONATTRS`, and makes one
`request(statements, row)` call of two statements through
`PostgresStore(cfg, role)`, then one `_query_many(..., snapshot=True, row=...)`
call on the same store. It fails until lane 1's T106 lands: at `a2073eae`
`load_config` does not know `register_url=`, and `PostgresStore` has no
register role. Its `[J3]` word is `sql_register_bounds and
postgres_store_register_roles`.

- THE `--version` PROBE: T106 asks `psql --version` once per process
  (L1v4.10:152). T203b's fake answers it itself, `psql (PostgreSQL) 16.4`,
  and logs it as an entry of its own kind (`"kind": "version"`, no `call`),
  so the calls that carry a request are the entries with no such `kind`.
  This module's own `--version` wrapper, which T220 carried until T203b was
  in, is gone (T220d; F10's item 25).

D9'S PHASE-N ROWS are real-engine tests, on `tests/pgcluster.py`'s `pg`. The
test plan names the rows but gives them no ids, so each row has a word that
leads its id (the block's T220): `guard`, `answer-2`, `reader`,
`renderer-reads`, `reconcile`, `import`, `status`, `migration`,
`outage-probe` and `mode-query` here. T257, T278 and T237 add theirs to the
same two functions. The faults (AT-D9, "Fixture"):

- F1, a listener on loopback that accepts and never speaks (`SilentListener`);
- F2, a relay to the cluster's socket that goes silent once the startup has
  completed, at the server's first ReadyForQuery (`StartupRelay`);
- F3, an `ALTER TABLE` in an open transaction of the test's own session on
  the table the path reads, or, for a writer's commit, the head row held
  `FOR UPDATE` (`_hold_head`; T257f);
- F4, a slow statement the test creates in its own database: a row-level
  security policy that sleeps, for the path's group role. F4 is the second
  function's, `test_a_slow_statement_meets_57014_before_the_client_timer`.

`c` is 2 s and `N_a` 1: no configuration sets `connect_timeout=` or
`register_addresses=`. Each bound is asserted at twice its value, and the
guard's two rows under 4.5 s strictly; each measured time is recorded with
its margin (section 1.2's timing rules 1 to 3). The paths are lane 1's
commands, and lane 5's guard through `lanes-edit.sh guard`, from T203's
flipped copy where the path reads on primary. They fail until L1-A2, L1-A13,
L1-A15, L1-A18 and L5-A3 land, on T227's template and T228's logins; until
T228 a path's login is made here, in the row's group role.

THE GUARD'S TWO ROWS' SESSION (T203c's `guard_session`; T220d): today's guard
reads this workstation's session records after its workspace and tmux checks
and before any register read, and refuses 2 where none is live in its window.
So each guard row, `guard` and `answer-2`, is given a live session record
and a stand-in `tmux` by `guard_session(home, bin, checkout)` (the checkout
under `$HOME/projects`), its `env()` and its `hook_input()`, torn down by
`request.addfinalizer(session.close)`; and the case's base environment is
`guard_strip_env(os.environ)`, which takes `PROJECTS_ROOT` and
`AGENT_PROTOCOL_ROOT` out beside the lane's, the harness's, tmux's and
libpq's.

THE BENCH'S REGISTER NAMES THE LIVE SESSION (T220e): its `lanes/LANES.md` holds
one row, binding the lane's window `repoA-2` to `SID`, the id the guard
session is made with, in `test_lanes_index.py`'s row form (T203c's own unit
test uses it). So the guard's checks on the checkout's register all pass, and
what can refuse the prompt on the bench is the database alone. Without the row,
today's guard refuses 2 at its row check, "the register has no row for
`repoA-2`", which is also exit 2 within 4.5 s, so the guard rows would pass
against a guard that never reads the database. With it, today's guard lets the
prompt through, 0, and the guard rows fail by their exit assertion until L5-A3
and L5-A5 land.

THE TIMING WRAPPER (`TIMING_PSQL`): T203's shim records neither a call's
start time nor its stderr, so F4's oracle, "the call ending with 57014 ... no
earlier than the path's `statement_timeout` after the call's start", reads
this module's own wrapper in front of the real `psql`, which logs each
call's start and end on the monotonic clock and its stderr's first line.
Its first statement also stamps the call's begin, with its parent's pid, in
`psql-begin.log`, before it reads stdin, so a call its caller's timer kills
is stamped too (T220f).

THE SERVICE ROW'S F4 (T237y; line W3aX's finding on T237x): one guard run
meets a cold service, which answers `unavailable` until its `psql` has
connected (socket contract d8:502), and the service's connection is "one
long-lived `psql` child on pipes" (d8:229), which `TIMING_PSQL`, reading its
input to the end before it starts the real `psql`, can never run. So
`[service]`'s case starts `lanes-index serve` once, puts `STREAM_PSQL` first
on `PATH` in place of `TIMING_PSQL`, and warms the service with guard runs
until one is answered through it, with no fallback line (d8, section 5.3);
only then does it make F4's slow statement and run the guard again.
`STREAM_PSQL` starts the real `psql` at once and hands its input on chunk by
chunk, stamping each, so the held child runs through it; the 57014 timed is
the held child's, from the stamp of the request it was handed to its
`ERROR:  57014` line, at the request's 180 ms (lane 5's answer 3, #165
comment 6771208498; d8:214), the child known by its own argv's
`VERBOSITY=sqlstate` (d8:229).

`STATUS`'S TWO ROWS (T220f; lane 3's T220 bullet, #165 comment 6772120103,
and its ruling 6, 6770600106) time the register's request alone, from its
start to the exit, never from the command's start: `status` runs #160's half
first, whose `lanes-edit.sh` calls took 17 to 23 s each under load (lane 1's
T117 point 6, 6769905855). `[status-F1]`, `[status-F2]` and `[status-F3]`
take `Bench.request_elapsed()`: from the begin stamp of the first `psql` that
the command's own process starts on the register's path (its once-per-process
`psql --version`, which T117's `_run_register` counts inside the request's
client timer, or else the request's own call) to the command's exit.
`[status]`'s 57014 time was already the request's own call, from its start
to its end, as every row's is.

    Once the fault is removed, the rerun, `cutover` again with the push
    still failing (lane 3's batch 11 (7)(c), #165 6783909985), reads the
    switch. After `before` the abort did not land, so the rerun runs it
    again, one `switch_to_files` call, and ends with the abort's 2, the
    switch `files` with the marker `absent`. After `timer` it landed, and
    the switch at `files` with the marker `absent` is also "before any
    cutover" (Y:1531), so the rerun runs no abort for that entry and goes on
    as a first cutover would: its first write call is `commit_write`, never
    `switch_to_files`; with the push still failing it then aborts its own
    entry once and ends 2, the switch `files` with the marker `absent` and
    the head back at the import's seq. "Sends nothing" (TP:3641-3642 at B14)
    cannot hold, and B15 drops it. It fails until lane 1's L1-A14 and lane
    3's T327 land."""
