"""Feature 007's D22 and AT-F18: the disaster path (L2-G4; L2-G5's AT-F18;
AT-D22; AT-F18; T274; FR-053, FR-059) (opensoft/openRepoTools#165).

T274 writes this module: 12 tests, AT-D22's 6 and AT-F18's 6 (B15 tasks:2511,
"Write D22 and AT-F18, the disaster path"). The test plan's AT-F18 gives the
label rules' test four ids, `[no-label-reimport]`, `[no-label-restore]`,
`[own-label-at-primary]` and `[reimport-at-files]`, so T274's verify, which
names that function bare, collects 15 ids from the 12 tests.

THE ESTATE, `Disaster` (the test plan's AT-D22, "Fixture"):

- CLUSTER A, the live database: section 5.6's TLS cluster, T229's
  `tls_cluster`, stoppable, with SCRAM on loopback. The register is a database
  of its own on it, made empty and bootstrapped through the admin service with
  `--label register-a` (`TLSCluster.second_database`). The engineer `ds`'s two
  logins are made on it by `lanes-index login add ds` under a pty; the dump
  login, `lanes_register_dump`, is the one T228's `login add --dump-job` made
  on the same cluster when its template was built.
- A BARE ORIGIN WITH THE FIXTURE REGISTER, test 7's (pgcluster's
  `ImportedRegister`, T227b). Its operator checkout, with its W and
  `workspace.yaml`, is ws1's: the operator lane `repoA-2` on `Eagle` (F12).
- WS1'S TOOLS AND CONFIGURATION, as test 13's drill has them: T203's flipped
  `lanes-index` (`RENDER_GIT_HALF = True`), `lanes-edit.sh`, `lanes`,
  `lane-start` and `repos.tsv` beside it, check 1's digest list, and a 0600
  `lanes-index.conf` naming `ds`'s two logins over `verify-full` with their
  password files, `register_label=` and `register_addresses=1`. In front of
  them on `PATH`: test 5's `git` wrapper, which fails each `fetch`, or the
  push of the commit carrying one `Register-Seq`, when armed, and section
  3.2's `psql` shim, which logs every request.
- A WRITTEN THROUGH `m`, THEN `k`: the import at C (T115) and the first
  cutover (T116, T327) from ws1, `set-mode primary` (T120), then writes on
  primary from ws1, `log NOTED` (lane 4's T415), each forking its render (lane
  4's T416; lane 3's T321 to T323). The first `RENDERED` writes reach origin,
  so `m` is the mirror's last `Register-Seq`. The wrapper then fails every
  `fetch`, and the next writes are each waited for by the renderer's exit
  (open point 8's second wait: a failed `fetch` logged, then a free
  `lanes-render.lock`), so `k` is the head and `status` shows a lag of
  `k - m`. The restore branch's backup is taken between them, at `b`.
- THE BACKUP (act 3's daily dump): O2's command, `pg_dump --format=custom` of
  both schemas as `lanes_register_dump` over TLS, its password file from its
  environment; `b` is read from the file alone by `pg_restore --data-only
  --schema=lanes_register --table=register_head --file=-`. `pg_dump` and
  `pg_restore` are the fixture's, from its binaries' directory (open point 15).
- THE LOSS: `status` reads A at `k` (recording `h`), A is stopped, `status`
  prints `m` and `h`, the outage is declared on ws1 (D20), and A is destroyed.
- CLUSTER B, the replacement: a TLS cluster of the test's own whose template
  holds nothing, so no register role exists on it; its one database stands
  for the one the admin creates first (R-P41). One admin service naming it
  serves every step (R1's S4): `bootstrap --roles-only`, then for the
  re-import `bootstrap --label register-b` and `login add ds` and `login add
  --dump-job`; for the restore `login add` for both, `pg_restore
  --exit-on-error --no-password` through the service, then `bootstrap
  --label register-b`, which prints `unchanged`.
- THE RE-POINTING (F18): ws1's configuration is rewritten in one edit,
  `register_url=`, `reader_url=`, their password files and
  `register_label=`, B's, before any `lanes-index` command of ws1's reaches
  B. A second configuration that still reaches A keeps A's label: the host
  not yet re-pointed.

WHAT EACH FAILS UNTIL. B15's Order (tasks:2511's last bullet): it waits for
T205, and its tests fail until L1-A7, L1-A13 and T327 land. Each labelled
assertion also names the tasks its own commands rest on: `bootstrap` and
`--roles-only` (T109, L1-A7); `login` (T110); `import --at` and `--after-loss`
(T115, L1-A13); `cutover` in its three forms (T116, L1-A14) and its marker's
push, read-back, `record_marker`, the restore form's render and the abort's
trigger (lane 3's T327); `set-mode` (T120); `status`'s two seqs (T117) and the
declaration (T121, L1-A18); `ready`'s check 10 (T119); a write on primary
(lane 4's T415) and its render's fork (T416), rendered by lane 3's T321 to
T323; the pending record, its generation and exit 3's printed rerun (lane 4's
T412 and T417); the rollback (T304, lane 3's T326). The label rules (direct
calls, T107) and `--roles-only` (T109) rest on nothing else, and can pass on
line R now. The host still on the live database needs A at `primary` with the
marker `present`, so T327 alone.

READINGS, NOT FOUND IN A CONTRACT:
- WHICH ESTATE EACH RUNS. The re-import, the restore, the abort, `status` and
  the restore route's label run A through `m` and `k`. The host still on the
  live database runs on A at `primary` just after the cutover: its oracle reads
  no lag. AT-F18's four estate cases run D22's re-import with A written
  through `m` and then the write in doubt at `m`, with no lost tail after it,
  since their oracles read only the record and B's generation.
- THE PENDING RECORD "for a write at a seq up to `m`" is a write whose commit
  call is lost before COMMIT (the shim's `no-reconnect` arm, `as: before`, as
  T244's `exit3` makes one): it ends 3 with its record kept and its printed
  rerun, at head `m`, and its effect is on neither A nor the mirror, so B's
  effect check finds it absent.
- "LR007'S TEXT" is read as naming the write id and both generations, as
  `commit_write`'s LR007 message does ("write <id> belongs to register
  generation <A>, not <B>").
- "A PLAIN RERUN AFTER IT FINDS NO RECORD OF A'S": the same command with no
  variable, after the replacement's write, is not refused for A's record: it
  exits 0, names neither A's id nor A's generation, and journals a write of its
  own.
- THE ABORT'S DUMP orders each of the twelve tables by its primary key's
  columns, as `pg_index` gives them, and holds each row as `to_jsonb` prints
  it. `stderr`'s first line naming the abort is read as carrying "abort".
- `bootstrap` on B runs with `--no-passwords`: no password of the indexer's
  is under test here, and the logins' are `login add`'s (as pgcluster's own
  bootstrap runs).

HELPERS COPIED, NEVER SHARED (a module's own): the drill's `Workstation`
form, `_rows`, `_renders`, `RENDER_SET`, `REGISTER_SEQ`, `LAG_0`, `CHECK_LINE`,
`_checks`, `mirror_problem` and `wait_for_seq` from T276's
`test_sql_register_drill.py` (line DR's `ca9b1a3a`); test 5's `git` wrapper
from T273b's `GIT_WRAPPER` (`test_sql_register_rollback.py`, this base), with
a `fail` arm and a push arm added; AT-LR006's entries (`_entry` and its
kinds) from T273's `RollbackRegister`; `exit3`'s arm, the record's path and
the rerun's two patterns from T244's `test_sql_register_in_doubt.py` (line
ID's `3965033`); O2's `DUMP_COMMAND`, the object lines and the three
database-level checks of `dump_restore_privileges` from T224's
`test_sql_register_managed.py` (line MG). From the fixture and H's helpers,
which each real-engine module imports: `tls_cluster`, `pg`, `TLSCluster`,
`ImportedRegister`, `PASSWORD_LINE`, `ClusterError`, `PSQL_SHIM`,
`flipped_copy` and `guard_strip_env`.

THE PATH (wave 11's policy, mask and never drop): no call here drops a `PATH`
directory. ws1 puts its fake `tmux`, the wrapper and the shim, its tools and
the engine's binaries first, and keeps every inherited directory behind them.

Every wait here has a ceiling: each poll, `SETTLE_S`; each command, its
`timeout`. Every id is RE: without PostgreSQL 16 it skips with T205's banner.
