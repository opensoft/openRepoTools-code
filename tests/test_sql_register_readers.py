"""TEST C5: THE SQL REGISTER'S READERS (feature 007, T217, L2-N4; the test
plan's AT-C5; R29; FR-033, FR-034, FR-036, FR-059).

This module supersedes lane 5's seed of the same name (T502 part 1,
`refs/l5/T502`), and keeps its one test, `lanes --decide`, by name.

WHAT IT HOLDS, by its five sources:

  * AT-C5's sixteen (the test plan, "The readers' table, the one-call
    failure, and the callers' default arms"): each reader by the design's
    S3 table with the store unreachable; each mirror read's `read: mirror`
    line; the `none` arms; the read door's classification, a hygiene test;
    the callers that act on a listing; one failed call anywhere in a caller's
    read sequence; `lane-start`'s seven read arms at 75 and 3, and at 69; the
    other callers' arms (lane 4's table, "The callers' default arms (Q9)");
    the writer's printed rerun relayed on a 3; an expectation's 2 at
    `lane-start`'s last write; `register-row-local`; `lane-worktrees`' reads;
    `--index` on primary; and `managed-projection`.
  * Lane 1's three (L1v4.5's T113 and T114): `guard_second_read_at`,
    `log_key_hex_slot` and `journal_last_pickaxe`, each `lanes-index`'s own,
    on a real engine.
  * Lane 5's nine (A5; T504 to T506 and T509), their guessed names kept.
  * Lane 4's two read verbs (R29; GB section 4.3; T401), `register-text` and
    `register-grep`, with T401's two exit-2 cases each (O21a), and
    `register-grep`'s one snapshot and quoted names on primary (lane 3's Q2
    and Q3, #165 6851977580).
  * Lane 4's `key()` trim (T259; R31; GB section 4.3; T426): the one test that
    asks `retired-identity` about spellings that differ only past the
    sixteenth digit, in files mode and on primary.
  * Lane 2's T235 (F13b's proposed task, for lane 3 to place; lane 5's
    choice (b), #165 6778955065): on primary, T505's three read sites,
    `known_lanes`, `remote_log_events` and `worktree_rows`, read the store and
    never git, by the fake `git`'s argv log, on a real engine; and its
    moved-head ids, T505's two reruns where the head moves under a read, on
    the stub door (lane 5's proposal, #165 6860943489; lane 3, 6861148117).

THE ARMS' IDS ARE THEIR LINES AT `2a057a6d`, as the test plan names them (the
block, T217), so they move with slices 1a and 1b and are re-cited at each
landing. `test_the_other_callers_arms_pass_the_code_or_refuse_as_lane_4s_
table_gives` names each arm's script first (lane 4's question 2, #165
6752694348), `<script>-<lines at 2a057a6d>-<code>`, so `-k
'the_other_callers_arms and lane-end'`, `and lane-handoff`, `and
skill-handoff`, `and skill-restart`, `and lane-rename`, `and lane-worktrees`
and `and lane-start` each select one script's arms; the bare `lane` script's
arms are `lane-416`, `lane-444`, `lane-1058` and `lane-1144`, which a word
selects by its line (`and (lane-416 or lane-444 or lane-1058 or lane-1144)`),
since `lane-` alone also matches every other script's. Each arm's `Arm`
names its line at the base this module was built on (`a2073eae`, with
T207c), found by its text at `2a057a6d`.

TWO STORES, ONE REGISTER. Every primary case here runs the CHECKOUT's
`lanes-edit.sh`, copied beside the contract's stub `lanes-index` (T207's
`contract_stub`, CLI4.5 section 6's copy rule, at drafts 4.10 and 4.11 since
T207c), on a workstation whose configuration says `mode=primary`. The stub's
register (the "store") holds the git register's files plus one row the git
register lacks, `STORE_ONLY_LANE`; so an answer that names it came from the
store, and one that does not came from the mirror. A small wrapper in front
of the stub (`DOOR_WRAPPER`) counts the register calls and fails the ones a
case names, the way the store fails when it cannot be reached: 69, `mode
primary` on stdout, and the cause on stderr (CLI4.5 section 3.6's exits).
That is the one-call failure's counter, at the `lanes-index` seam: the fake
`psql`'s own counter is the real `lanes-index`'s, which lane 1's three use.

THE ARMS' WRAPPER (AT-C5's fixture). `ARM_EDIT` is a `LANES_EDIT` that runs
the checkout's `lanes-edit.sh` for every verb but the one under test, which
exits the code under test and prints nothing on stdout; for the rerun cases
it prints the writer's rerun line on stderr. It logs each call of the verb
under test, so every arm case first asserts that its arm was REACHED, and a
case that never reaches its arm fails on that, never vacuously.

NO NETWORK. Every remote is a bare repository under `tmp_path`, `tmux`,
`claude` and `gh` are fakes, and `$HOME` is temporary. The real-engine cases
take `pg` from `tests/pgcluster.py` and skip where no PostgreSQL 16 is found,
unless `OPENREPOTOOLS_REQUIRE_PG=1`.

WHAT EACH WAITS FOR (the block's Order): L4-A1, L5-A4 and L5-A5; lane 1's
three for L1v4.5's T113 and T114; lane 5's for T504 to T506 and T509; the
`--decide` test for T502; the read verbs' for lane 4's T401, the one-snapshot
and quoted-name cases for its round on lane 3's Q2 and Q3 (#165 6851977580);
the arms for
lane 4's T402 to T408; `key()`'s trim, on primary only, for lane 4's T426;
T235's for lane 5's T505, its three door forms included, whose oracles are
lane 3's batch 7 (#165 6780364102), by batch 5's answers 3 and 4; and its
moved-head notes id for T505 round 2b's B.
Every case on `RealRegister` (lane 1's three and `managed-projection`'s RE
case) also fails until lane 2's T227 (`tmpl` built by the bootstrap) and
T228 (the `lanes_w_fx` and `lanes_r_fx` logins), each by the fixture's own
assertion (T217h).

#: read site with no prefetched file). `"move_each": {"key": k, "times": t,
#: "path": p, "line": l}` moves the store's head by one seq at each of the
#: first `t` form-3 reads of `--log-key=<k>`, before the store answers it,
#: appending `l % <the move's number>` to `p`, which the first move makes where
#: `p` is absent: a write that lands between a reader's calls (T401's one
#: snapshot, T217zh; T505's two reruns, T235e). With `"generation": true` the
#: move keeps `n` and gives the store a new generation instead, the append
#: made in the image at `n`: a new generation whose head lands on the same `n`
#: (T217zh's `[generation-moved]`). Every other call is the contract stub's,
#: in `store/`.

#: THE ARMS' WRAPPER, a `LANES_EDIT` (AT-C5's fixture). `ARM_VERB` is the

#: one that fails, the REAL verb with every store read failing the same way,
#: logged to `ARM_LOG.reread`: the caller's re-read meets the store still
#: down, as a `69)` arm's re-read under `LANES_READ_MIRROR=1` must, since a

#: several verbs joined by `|`, for a write one build makes as its own verb
#: and another carries in a call of another verb (`lane-start`'s writes in
#: `start-record`'s one call, lane 4's T428). `ARM_ACT_BASE`, where set, is

#: exit with the store unreachable, and whether 8 is barred ("never 8").
#: `lane`, `lane-end` and `lane-rename` are the callers' cases below; the
#: listings are the mirror test's; the guard reads its hook JSON on stdin.

#: THE GUARD'S SESSION (AN13a's B3). The hook's JSON is compact, as the harness
#: sends it, since the guard's `jstr` reads `"cwd":"<dir>"` with no blank after
#: the colon; and the guard runs in the lane's window, `repoA-2`, whose row names
#: `UUID_A2`, with a live session record whose `cwd` is under `$HOME/projects`.
#: Without that record it refuses 2 before any read, and T507's prefetch comes
#: after the session-record check (lane 3's T507 ruling (1), #165 6783977598).
#: T203c's `helpers.guard_session` makes both, as W4a's T215e runs AT-P3's
#: guard; it is looked up only when the case runs, so the module loads on a
#: tree whose helpers predate T203c.

    `primary` with the marker `present` by the documented functions, as
    AT-LR006's fixture does (`test-plan-v3f.md:4610-4615`): as the writer's
    login, `commit_write` with an `import` entry holding the render set, then
    a `cutover` entry, which writes `lanes/STORE` alone (ruling 1), then
    `record_marker`. Each `write(...)` is one more committed `write` entry, a
    seq more. The import and each write are the entries lane 1's own helpers
    derive (item 9). A copy of the checkout's `lanes-index` with `RENDER_GIT_HALF`
    flipped True (T203's `flipped_copy`, PC-5) reads it as the reader's
    login, through a `mode=primary` configuration that names both logins.

    T217h, lane 5's five findings (#165 6771208498) and three of lane 2's own,
    each checked against lane 1's code at `refs/l1/T114`:
      1. the configuration names `reader_url=` beside `register_url=`, which
         `load_config` requires (`_check_register_connections`), with the
         writer's login in `register_url=` and the reader's in `reader_url=`;
      2. `lanes-index` is the flipped copy, never `REPO/lanes-index`, whose
         `RENDER_GIT_HALF = False` ends 78 (`register read`) or 2 (every
         other command, `journal` included) on `mode=primary`;
      3. the client version is the register schema's own `version`, as
         `lanes-index` sends `REGISTER_SCHEMA_VERSION`: `commit_write` and
         `record_marker` refuse a client above `version` or below
         `writers_from` with LR003, and 5000 is above `version`, which
         migration 1 sets to 1;
      4. `[refusal-78]` keeps `mode=primary` and reads through a copy
         flipped False (`unflipped`), Q6(c)'s 78; `mode=files` was a refused
         configuration, 1 under `--for guard`;
      5. the template holds no register until T227: the fixture refuses that
         by its own assertion, as T222's module does, never by a psql error;
      6. (lane 2's) the groups `lanes_register_writer` and
         `lanes_register_reader` are NOLOGIN (lane 1's role block), so every
         session logs in as T228's `lanes_w_fx` or `lanes_r_fx` (the block's
         T228), refused by the fixture's own assertion until T228;
      7. (lane 2's) the superuser is `pgcluster`'s, `lanes_test`: the cluster
         has no `postgres` role, so a superuser read names no user;
      8. (lane 2's) a render set's bytes (`render_set`) are taken as UTF-8
         text, as `_commit` reads them;
      9. (T217l; lane 3's batch 7, #165 6780364102, other ask (4), on N1f's
         doubt in T217h) the entries carry the rows `register commit`
         builds: the import is lane 1's `import_entry` and each write its
         `register_commit_entry`, the one set of derivation helpers
         `register commit` and `import --at` build every row with (lane 3's
         reading 7, #165 6755386771; ERR-49), loaded from the checkout's
         `lanes-index`, over a bare repository that holds each text's blob,
         as their `git cat-file` reads it. So `lanes`, `log_lines`,
         `register_lines` and `object_holds` hold the rows a real register
         would, edits and rows agree, and a log line written after the
         cutover is stamped `primary`, where `log_lines`' CHECK refuses an
         unreadable one with 23514, as it refuses `register commit`'s: the
         cases write well-formed lines. The cutover's entry writes
         `lanes/STORE` alone, from which no row is derived, and is built as
         before. T228's logins are kept.

    So every case built on it FAILS UNTIL T227 and T228 land, beside the
    waits its own docstring names. UNVERIFIED HERE: this bench has no engine.
    The SQL names lane 1's functions as `refs/l1/T109`'s `lanes-index`
    creates them: `commit_write(bigint, uuid, integer, uuid, jsonb)`,
    `record_marker(integer, bigint, text, text)`, `schema_version.version`,

        that label, since the mirror read is a git read: the fake `git`'s

        and files mode's exit and stdout, with nothing of the store's before
        it; three reads, never a fourth;
      * `[decide-every-move]`: the same through a decide verb, `lanes
        --decide --all`: 69 with nothing on stdout and no mirror line; three
        reads;
      * `[worktree-rows-one-move]`: `worktrees` on primary (decide), one move,
        which writes `repoN-1`'s log, absent at n, whose `dir` places a tree:
        exit 0 with the listing at n + 1, byte for byte the same read's with
        no move, `repoN-1`'s tree in it, so the log list was pinned again;
        two reads. No move changes the archive, so its own re-pin is not seen
        here beyond that byte equality;
      * `[worktree-rows-every-move]`: 69 with nothing on stdout and no mirror
        line; three reads;
      * `[worktree-rows-notes-once]`: `[worktree-rows-one-move]` with T235's
        case pair in the register, so the listing notes each of its two logs
        as unreadable and fences them (`lanes_rows`): each note is printed as

        a dropped run; before it, each run of `lanes_rows` says them again.

    The stub door, not `RealRegister`: `move_each` moves the contract stub's

    """ONE SNAPSHOT (T401's Q2: lane 3's ruling, #165 6851977580, taking lane
    5's detect-and-retry, #165 6851740524; tasks:859 at `94fab177`). On
    primary `register-grep -E <ERE> -- lanes/log` takes `.head`'s `n=` and
    `generation=` after `reg_paths`, and again after its last image; where
    either moved, it drops the answer and runs again from `reg_paths`, three
    runs at most, and then exits 69 with nothing on stdout.
    THE STUB MOVES THE HEAD BETWEEN CALLS (the door's `move_each`): at each
    of the first `moves` reads of `--log-key=repoX+1`, before the store
    answers it, one write appends a NOTED line to `repoA-2`'s log. Every run
    makes that read, as its last image, after `repoA-2`'s image came from the
    prefetch's cache at `n`; the read finds `repoA-2` changed in `(n, n']`, so
    form 3 rewrites the family at `n'`, and `.head` names `n'` (contract 3.6).
    `[one-move]`: one move, then a clean run, so the verb answers once, exit
    0, with what `git grep` prints over the store's tree at `n + 1`, the moved
    line among it, and nothing of the dropped run; `repoX+1` is read twice,
    once a run. `[three-moves]`: every run's head moves, so it ends 69 with
    nothing on stdout; `repoX+1` is read three times, and never a fourth.
    `[generation-moved]`: the one move gives the store a new generation and
    keeps `n`, appending the line in the image at `n` (a new generation whose
    head lands on the same `n`). The read finds `.head`'s generation not the
    store's, so form 3 rewrites the whole family at `n` under the new one
    (contract 3.6). Only the generation half of the pair tells the runs
    apart, so a T401 that compares `n` alone answers the first run, without
    the moved line, and fails on stdout. The verb answers once, exit 0, with
    what `git grep` prints over the store's tree at `n` after the move;
    `repoX+1` is read twice; the head keeps `n` under a new generation (lane
    2's RV23 NIT 3).
    FAILS UNTIL lane 4's T401 round on lane 3's Q2 ruling, which was not
    bundled when this case was written. On lane 4's `6318d5e5` (#165
    6851877746), which reads once, `[one-move]` fails on stdout, its answer
    straddling `n` and `n + 1`, so `repoA-2`'s moved line is missing, and
    `[three-moves]` on its exit, 0 with lines, not 69 (T217zh)."""
