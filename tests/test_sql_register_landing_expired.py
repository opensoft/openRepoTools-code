"""Feature 007's AT-F13 (opensoft/openRepoTools#165, L2-W5; lane 2's T253):
`LANDING EXPIRED`'s verb, `append-line --landing-expired`, and a take with no
UTC.

THE RULING (F13, Brett's "Adopt, on my word (Recommended)", #165 6721583757;
U3 and U7, lane 3's ruling, #165 6722541787; lane 4's section, "`LANDING
EXPIRED`'s verb"): on primary a `LANDING EXPIRED` line is written only by
`append-line --landing-expired <holder> --pr <n> --repo <repo>`, with Brett's
word as `--word`, `--word-where` and `--word-utc`. The form copies the holder,
the PR, the repository's token and the UTC from the holder's open `LANDING` at
`n`, byte for byte, the newest post where there are several; it refuses with
2, sending nothing, without the word, off primary, and where that `LANDING` is
not open or is 30 minutes old or less by the snapshot's clock. On primary
`append-line` refuses, before the lock, the kind typed by hand and a take whose
UTC it cannot read (U3). F13's check in the commit decides what the line
releases; its LR005 exits 2 with the server's message and its DETAIL token,
and a caller that branches reads the token, never the message (U7). On primary
`who --landing` no longer lists a released `LANDING`, through `RULE6_PRIMARY`,
`rule6_primary_on` and `RULE6_EXPIRED_AWK`; off primary `RULE6_AWK` is
byte-identical to today's.

THE CASES: (a) to (g) and (k) to (m) are FP; (i) and (j) are RE, on T205's
`pg_cluster`, skipped without PostgreSQL 16 by its banner. Case (h), with
its rollback, is T279's, RE, at the module's end. The fifteenth test, new
since v3f, is T112's AT-F13
case (R-F10-34): `register commit` expires an imported stale `LANDING` by
Rule 6's key, the shipped table then the per-wip one (RE; at its section).

THE FP BENCH (`Bench`): `lanes-edit.sh` copied beside a `lanes-index` that is
T207's contract stub (`contract_stub`, CLI4.5 section 6's copy rule, with
`repos.tsv` and `lane-start` beside it), behind a small wrapper that sets the
clock `register snapshot` prints to the test's `CLOCK`, far from `date` (D13:
every age is the snapshot's time less the `LANDING`'s UTC). The stub's
register at `n` holds the case's `lanes/LANES.md`, as the files-mode workspace
under it does (test 1's sync form, `test_sql_register_render.py`'s
`workspace`), and its `register read` is the fake prefetch. T203's register
fake `psql` is first on `PATH`, and the configuration names a Unix socket
directory (the fake-`psql` host rule, L1v4.5:525; lane 1, #165 6741670709 item
9). "Nothing sent" is read here as: no `register commit` reached the stub and
no `psql` call was made; on primary T424's and T425's refusals run in the
attempt's child, after the parent's snapshot and before its seam, so a
snapshot call may precede a refusal (B11 tasks:1087, :1152, :1271). Beside
the checkout, each lane the module writes for has its own register checkout,
`<W>-lanes/<lane>`, a clone of the same origin (`WRITE_LANES`; lane 3's
(119), #165 6813027223), as every estate at primary does.

WHAT THEY FAIL UNTIL. At this base `lanes-edit.sh` never asks `lanes-index`
its mode and writes the files whatever it would say, and its `append-line`
takes `--landing-expired` as the line's text. So every FP case is red by its
own assertion, and fails until lane 4's T424 (L4-B10's refusals) and T425
(L4-B10, the form, `RULE6_PRIMARY` and `RULE6_EXPIRED_AWK`), with T415's
attempt loop (L4-B3) and lane 5's T504 (the mode door, `reg_open`) under them;
(g) fails only until lane 1's T118 (L1-A16), and (i) and (j) until lane 1's
T107, T111 and T112 (L1-A6, L1-A9, L1-A10) and lane 2's T227 and T228, with
T425 for the form and the awk.

      the entry's `Register-Seq`, before `record_marker` names it, as T327's
      push would. A rollback needs that origin: it renders onto the mirror
      of this database and removes `lanes/STORE` from it (T326).
    - Lane B's and lane C's `LANDING`s are committed as (i) commits its
      lines: one commit call each, the entry `append-line` would send.
    - "A ROLLBACK TO FILES" is `lanes-index rollback` as the operator lane,
      then `set-mode index` on this workstation, as Brett runs it at the
      rollback's step 5 (operations.md 2.3), so `who --landing` reads the
