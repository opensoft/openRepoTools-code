"""Stand-ins for feature 007's SQL-register tests (L2-0d): the copies and the
stubs of `lanes-index`, and the `psql`s a test puts first on `PATH`.

Test modules import it from `tests/`, as three modules import
`package_layout.py`. What it holds:

- `flipped_copy(source, dest, value)`: `source`, a `lanes-index`, copied to
  `<dest>/lanes-index` with its one `RENDER_GIT_HALF = …` line rewritten to
  `value`, True or False. It takes the constant in either state, so test 14's
  refusing copy still builds once lane 3's T328 sets it True (T277). There is
  no environment override, which would be a production bypass of Q6(c)'s
  refusal (the test plan's open point 3; PC-5). `dest` is a directory, so a
  test copies `lanes-edit.sh` and what it reads beside the copy, where
  `lanes-index` and `lanes-edit.sh` each look for the other.
- `primary_stub(directory)`: a stub `lanes-index` for the bash tests, at
  `<directory>/lanes-index`, that answers `mode` with `primary` and logs every
  call. The contract's whole stub is T207's `contract_stub`.
- `REGISTER_FAKE_PSQL`: the register's fake `psql` (the test plan's section
  3.2), which extends `test_lanes_index.py`'s `FAKE_PSQL`.
- `PSQL_SHIM`: section 3.2's shim in front of the real `psql`, armed per test
  by a control file beside it.
- `contract_stub(directory, register=None)` and `stub_outcome(directory,
  argv_prefix, …)`: the contract's stub `lanes-index`, as CLI4.5 §6 states
  it, and the outcomes a test injects into it (T207). `contract_stub`'s
  docstring is its manual.

THE FAKE-`psql` HOST RULE (lane 1's L1v4.5:525; #165 6741670709 item 9): the
fake and the shim are made for configurations whose `register_url=` names a
Unix socket or a loopback host (`localhost`, `127.0.0.0/8`, `::1`), or carries
`sslmode=verify-full` with an `sslrootcert=` naming a root file, never
`system`. Lane 1's T104 refuses any other at load (CLI4.5 §2.5), before any
`psql` runs.

THE ARGV LOG: each stub writes `<directory>/lanes-index.argv`, one line per
call, the call's arguments as one JSON array, so a test can assert that the
stub ran and what it was asked.

THE REGISTER'S FAKE `psql`. A test writes `REGISTER_FAKE_PSQL` to `<dir>/psql`,
makes it executable and puts `<dir>` first on `PATH`. Its environment:

- `FAKE_PSQL_LOG` (required) names its log: one JSON object per call, in call
  order, with `FAKE_PSQL`'s fields, `url`, `passfile`, `pgpassword` and
  `stdin`, and these besides:
  - `call`, the call's number in this log, from 1, counting only the calls
    that carry a request: a `psql --version` call is not counted (below);
  - `argv`, the whole argument list (P1475): what each path sends is the
    test's to assert, and the fake asserts no `VERBOSITY` for the calls the
    design leaves unnamed (the test plan's open point 29);
  - `connect_timeout`, `options` and `service`: `PGCONNECT_TIMEOUT`,
    `PGOPTIONS` (the path's `options=-c lock_timeout=… -c
    statement_timeout=…`) and `PGSERVICE`, each null where it is unset;
  - `pg`: every variable it received whose name begins `PG`, with its value,
    `PGPASSWORD`'s alone recorded as `*`, for T257's inherited-`PG*` cases
    (lane 3's R-PG-1, #165 6747611042).

  `url` is the connection rebuilt from the `PG*` variables, as lane 1's T103
  hands it on, `postgresql://<PGUSER>@<PGHOST>[:<PGPORT>]/<PGDATABASE>`, with
  no port where `PGPORT` is unset, and empty where none of the four is set.
- An argument that is `-d`, `--dbname` or one that holds a connection URL is
  refused: the call is logged with `refused`, and the fake exits 1. No
  register path puts a connection string in an argument list (Y:3491; CLI4.5
  §2.2 and §6).
- `psql --version`, a call whose whole argument list is `--version`, is a
  call of its own kind. Lane 1's T106 runs it once per process on a register
  path, before it sends anything, and refuses a `psql` older than 15 with 69,
  naming its version, with nothing sent (L1v4.10:152; lane 1, #165
  6752661856). The fake reads no stdin for it and answers `psql (PostgreSQL)
  16.4` (`PSQL_VERSION_LINE`) with exit 0, unless a `version` rule in
  `FAKE_PSQL_ANSWERS` answers it. Its log entry is
  `{"kind": "version", "url": …, "passfile": …, "pgpassword": …, "argv":
  ["--version"], "connect_timeout": …, "options": …, "service": …, "pg":
  {…}}`, with no `call` and no `stdin`. So the calls that carry a request are
  the entries with no `kind`, a case counting them leaves the probe out
  (`e.get("kind") != "version"`), and their `call` numbers are the ones a
  test without the probe sees.
- `FAKE_PSQL_ANSWERS` (optional) names a JSON file: a list of answers, each
  taught for the calls it names. The first that names a call answers it:
  - it names calls by `call` (that call alone), `from` (every call from that
    one on) and `match` (a text the call's stdin carries), all that it gives
    holding; an answer with none of the three names every call;
  - it answers with `sleep` (seconds, before anything else: a hang past the
    caller's timer), then `stdout` and `stderr`, then `signal` (a name, such
    as `KILL`, that the fake sends itself: a death by a signal) or `exit`
    (default 0);
  - a rule with `"kind": "version"` names the `psql --version` calls, every
    one, and only them: it takes no `call`, `from` or `match`, and answers
    as any rule does. Every other rule names only the calls that carry a
    request. So T257's `[snapshot-psql-14]` teaches `{"kind": "version",
    "stdout": "psql (PostgreSQL) 14.11\\n"}`, and a `--version` that hangs or
    fails is taught with `sleep` or `exit`.

  So the 69 refusal is `{"call": 1, "exit": 2}`; the retry's shape is
  `{"match": "commit_write", "exit": 3, "stderr": "ERROR:  40001: could not
  serialize access due to concurrent update\\n"}`; and a code taught for exit
  3 is taught as `ERROR:  <SQLSTATE>: <message>`, an LR005 or an LR007 with its
  `DETAIL:  <token>` line after it (section 3.2, "The line it is taught").
- A call no answer names is answered as `FAKE_PSQL` answers it, as an empty
  schema-1 store would, with `FAKE_PSQL_VERSION_FILE` read as it reads it.

THE SHIM. A test writes `PSQL_SHIM` to `<dir>/psql`, makes it executable,
puts `<dir>` first on `PATH`, ahead of the directory of the real `psql`, and
arms it by writing `<dir>/psql-shim.json`. It runs as `python3 -I`, standard
library only. With no control file it hands every call on unchanged. The
control file:

- `psql` (optional): the real `psql` to hand calls to; otherwise the first
  `psql` on `PATH` that is not the shim.
- `version` (optional): the line the shim answers `psql --version` with,
  `psql (PostgreSQL) 16.4` (`PSQL_VERSION_LINE`) where it is absent, such as
  `"psql (PostgreSQL) 14.11"` for T257's `[snapshot-psql-14]`. A call whose
  whole argument list is `--version` (lane 1's T106 probe, once per process
  on a register path: L1v4.10:152) is answered by the shim itself, that line
  and exit 0, and is never handed on: it reads no stdin, no arm applies to it,
  and it is not counted in `call`, `from` or the state.
- `arms`: a list, each arm a mode and the calls it applies to. An arm names
  calls by `call` (call k alone), `from` (every call from call k on) or
  `match` (a text the call's script carries, such as `find_write` for a
  lookup try or `commit_write` for a commit call). With `match`, `call` and
  `from` count only the calls that carry the text, so `{"match":
  "commit_write", "call": 2}` is the second commit call. An arm with none of
  the three applies to every call. One test may arm several modes, each on
  its own calls.

The modes, with the keys each takes:

- `window`, `ms`: sleep before handing the call on;
- `before` and `after`: a `pg_terminate_backend(pg_backend_pid())` statement
  before or after the script's last `COMMIT`, joined with psql's `\\;`, so the
  call stays one request. `after` exits 2 once the call has landed; with
  `fifo`, it first blocks on that FIFO;
- `timer`, `ms` or `fifo`: run the real `psql`, then sleep, or block on the
  FIFO in place of the sleep, then answer as `psql` answered;
- `fail-call` (by `call` or `from`) and `fail-match` (by `match`): exit 2,
  sending nothing;
- `edit-entry`, `field` and `value`: rewrite one field of the commit call's
  entry, the `'…'::jsonb` argument of `commit_write(`, before handing the
  call on. `field` may be a dotted path, such as `act.base`, and must exist;
  without `value` the field is removed;
- `no-reconnect`, `as` (`before` or `after`): the first call the arm names
  is lost as that mode loses it, and every later call exits 2, sending
  nothing, as from a host that cannot reconnect;
- `hold`, `fifo`: block on the FIFO before handing the call on. A test's
  `open(fifo, "w")` returns once the call is held, and closing it lets the
  call go;
- `fork`, `fifo`, optional `exit`: start the call in a session of its own
  (`setsid`), where it blocks on the FIFO before it runs the real `psql`, and
  wait for it, so the caller's timer, which kills the shim, never reaches
  the call. With `"exit": true` the shim exits 2 once the fork is made.

Per call, the failures come first (a lost host, then `fail-call` and
`fail-match`), then `edit-entry`, `before` and `after` rewrite the script,
then `hold`, `window`, `fork`, the real `psql`, `after` and `timer`.

The shim writes, beside itself, `psql-shim.log`, one JSON object per call
when the call starts: `call`, `argv`, `stdin`, `sent` (the script as handed
on), `arms` (the modes applied), and the fake's `url`, `passfile`,
`pgpassword` and `pg`; `psql-shim.ends`, one line per call that ended, with
the codes; and its counters in `psql-shim.state`. A `psql --version` call's
entry in `psql-shim.log` is its own kind, `{"kind": "version", "argv":
["--version"], "url": …, "passfile": …, "pgpassword": …, "pg": {…}}`, with
no `call`, and it writes nothing to `psql-shim.ends` or the state, so the
calls that carry a request are the entries with no `kind`. A control file it
cannot read, an arm it does not know, or an arm that cannot apply to the call
it names (a `before` on a call with no `COMMIT`, an `edit-entry` field that is
not there) ends the call with exit 1 and `psql-shim: …` on stderr, recorded
in the log as `error`, sending nothing; on a `--version` call, so does a
control file it cannot read or a `version` that is not a string.

STANDARD LIBRARY ONLY, AND NOTHING FROM THE SUITE: no `conftest`, no pytest,
so the module loads the same way under pytest and under a task's
`python3 -I -c` verify, on Python 3.9 and up. Each script it writes is
standard library only too.

def contract_stub(directory, register=None) -> Path:
    """Write `<directory>/lanes-index`, the contract's stub `lanes-index`
    (T207; CLI4.5 §6, CLI4.5:881-903), and return its path: a Python script
    with a `#!/usr/bin/env python3` line and the executable bit, which a test
    runs by its path (R2's S8). `directory` is made if it is missing.

    THE COPY RULE (CLI4.5 §6, CLI4.5:885; O11): a test copies `lanes-edit.sh`,
    `repos.tsv` and `lane-start` beside the stub, where `lanes_index_bin` looks
    first, `$SCRIPT_DIR/lanes-index`.

    ITS REGISTER: the render set's files at each seq, under
    `<directory>/lanes-index.register/<seq>/`; its head, its generation and its
    journal in `<directory>/lanes-index.state`. Called again on one
    directory, it starts a new register and moves the old one aside. The head starts at seq 1, the
    generation's first, holding `register`, a mapping of render-set paths
    (`lanes/LANES.md`, `lanes/aliases.tsv`, `lanes/log/<lane>.md`,
    `lanes/archive/<name>`) to their text, empty by default. The generation
    is a new UUID. Each `register commit` that commits makes the next seq.

    WHAT IT ANSWERS, by CLI4.5's sections; every other end is a test's to
    inject with `stub_outcome`:

    - §3.1 `mode`: `primary`, 0; with any argument, 64.
    - §3.2 `register snapshot`: the argv's forms, each other form 64 (an id
      without `--generation`, `--at` without it, `--tree` without
      `--checkout`); check 1, the generation, 2 with `ERROR:  LR007: …` and
      `DETAIL:  generation`; check 2, the id found with its lane, verb and
      `args_sha256`, 0 with `found=` and its `file=` rows; check 2′, the id
      another write's, 2 with `DETAIL:  another-write`; then the `key=value`
      lines in §3.2's order, the id minted for `--write-id new`, `not_after=`
      the clock plus `C` plus 2 s. `--tree <dir> --checkout <c>` builds the
      scratch tree from the stub's register at `n` (or at `--at <k>`), with
      `lanes/repos.tsv` and `lanes/log/README.md` from `<c>`'s `origin/main`,
      one commit and `refs/remotes/origin/main` on it, and prints
      `repos_blob=`. Under `--at` only the generation is checked, and a seq
      outside the generation's journal is 69. `--files`, `--all` and `--out`
      (§3.6's image form) are not answered.
    - §3.3 `register commit`: the argv, each flag required (64); the attempt
      directory's check, 2 with `lanes-index: attempt directory: <what>;
      nothing was sent` (a listed file missing, an image with no `A` or `M`
      line, `files` and `changes.tsv` naming different paths, `files`
      differing from the images' rows, the flags differing from `snapshot`, a
      path outside the render set); then LR007 `generation` and
      `another-write` (2), LR006 (0, `already <seq>` and its `file=` rows),
      LR001 where `snapshot`'s `n=` is not the head (75), LR008 past
      `not_after` (75), and otherwise `committed <seq>`, 0.
    - §3.4 `journal --write-id …`: the argv (64); LR007 `generation` and
      `another-write` (2); `found <seq>` with its `file=` rows, or `absent`,
      0. It answers at once: the wait and the window are the real
      `journal`'s, and LR011 and the lookup's 3s are injected.
    - §3.5 `register classify`, as contract draft 4.10 states it
      (CLI4.10:629-638; lane 1, #165 6752238370), not CLI4.5:636's four
      fields: one LF-ended line per LF-cut input line, five TAB-separated
      fields, `<kind>`, `<slot_role>`, `<repo_key>`, `<utc_ts>` (epoch
      seconds) and `<lane>`, each `-` where absent; any argument 64, before
      stdin is read. The fields are the checkout's own: its
      `classify_register_line` (lane 1's T122) where `LANES_INDEX` has one,
      and before it CLI4.10:636's fields from its `REGISTER_KIND_RE`,
      `REGISTER_SLOTS` (T118) where it has them, and `parse_register_line`,
      so the stub holds no second classifier (CLI4.5:633). A test teaches
      other fields with `stub_outcome`.
    - §3.6's four forms of `register read`, as contract draft 4.10 and
      draft 4.11 state them (lane 1, #165 6752925109), each form's argv (an
      empty `--lane=` 64 in forms 2 and 4; `--lane` and `--log-key` only in
      the `=` form): the first stdout line `mode primary`; the cache family
      written by temp file and rename beside `--cache <file>`, `.head` last;
      a key outside `check_lane_name`'s class as `.log.%<hex>`, never cached;
      two logs that differ only by case written by no form; form 4's `.head`
      checks (69 where it is missing, names another generation, or `--at` is
      outside the journal), its one log at `--at`, and no `.head`.
      `.outage`, `.direct` and the guard's "too late" are injected.
      - `.head`'s rows (CLI4.10:699, :703; CLI4.11:703, S-a): a `file=` row
        for every path a member names at `n`, present or not, `1` and its
        digest or `0` and `-`; a set member (`archive`, and `--all`'s logs)
        one row per file it holds at `n`, its text cached or not, a log
        outside the class or one of a case pair included; a `log:<key>` that
        resolves to no log an `absent=` row instead.
      - `.paths` never holds `lanes/STORE` (CLI4.11:680): the register holds
        the render set alone.
      - Form 3 (CLI4.10:730-733): the cached paths changed in `(n, n′]` by
        their digests at `n′` (a row whose digest differs or is absent, a
        path created or removed against a cached `.paths` or under a cached
        set member, an `absent=` key that now resolves), printed as `n=<n′>`,
        one `changed=<path>` per path, sorted, and `refetched=0` or `1`;
        where any is found, or `.head` is missing or names another `n` or
        generation, the whole family rewritten at `n′`, `.head` last;
        otherwise the members `--files` names, with their rows added. It
        exits 69 only for a key it was asked for, by `--files` or
        `--log-key=`; a cached member that now matches two logs is dropped
        from the family, its `.log.<key>` and `.logpath.<key>` removed
        (CLI4.11:673, N-g). Whether a family holds `--all`'s set of logs is
        the stub's own record, `lanes-index.sets` beside the stub, true only
        for the `.head` it wrote with it.
    - §3.7 `render --checkout <c>`: one JSON line per call in
      `<directory>/lanes-index.render`, its argv and its environment (the
      value of a variable whose name holds TOKEN, SECRET, PASSWORD, PASSWD or
      KEY recorded as `*`), and "git half not installed" on stderr, 69.
    - Anything else: 64, unless a test injects an outcome for it.

    Every call is logged to `<directory>/lanes-index.argv`, one JSON array of

    given), printing `stdout` and `stderr`. The last injected outcome whose
    prefix matches answers, after the call's argv has been checked (64 still
    comes first).

    - `committed=True`: the call first does what it would, its own answer
      dropped, as "committed, then exit 3", agreement test 12's pair.
    - `hang=<seconds>`: it sleeps first, a hang past the caller's timer.
    - Each LR code is its `exit` with `stderr` in §2.6's shape, such as
      `"ERROR:  LR005: <message>\\nDETAIL:  main-held\\n"` with 2.
    - On `journal --write-id`, a crash (`exit=1`, a traceback on stderr) and an
      unknown code (any other) are the caller's to read as 3 (CO-2).
