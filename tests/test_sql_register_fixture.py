"""The real-engine fixture's switch, `OPENREPOTOOLS_REQUIRE_PG` (#165, L2-0b).

THE TEST PLAN'S SECTION 3.3, ITS FOUR CASES. `tests/pgcluster.py` gives the
tests that need a real PostgreSQL 16 their cluster, and `tests/conftest.py`
registers it from its `pytest_configure`. The switch decides what a missing
engine is:

  * unset or `0`, a SKIP of every real-engine test, whose reason names
    `PG_BIN` and the package `postgresql-16`, loud even under `-q`;
  * `1`, as CI sets it, a REFUSAL of the whole run before any test starts:
    pytest's own `UsageError`, exit 4, even where the run selects no
    real-engine test (the refusal is eager);
  * anything else, a refusal too, as `OPENREPOTOOLS_COMPOSED` refuses a
    value that is neither.

EACH CASE RUNS A CHILD PYTEST, since a refusal ends the session that makes it.
The child is `python -m pytest` on this suite's own `conftest.py`, with no
`OPENREPOTOOLS_*`, `PG*` or `PYTEST_ADDOPTS` of the outer run, and with only
what the case sets. Its real-engine test is a PROBE written into the case's
own temporary directory, which asks for `pg`, one database cloned from the
session's template: the suite holds no such test of its own until the
template's tasks land, and a case must not wait for one.

A REAL-ENGINE TEST IS ONE WHOSE FIXTURE CLOSURE HOLDS `pg_engine`, the
session fixture through which every cluster of `tests/pgcluster.py` finds its
binaries, or skips, or fails. A test asks for `pg`, `pg_cluster`,
`stoppable_cluster` or a cluster built on them, and the closure pytest
computes from their definitions reaches `pg_engine`. So the last case reads
pytest's public `fixturenames`, and a cluster fixture added later is held to
the rule by depending on `pg_engine`, as each one must to find the binaries.

Until `tests/conftest.py` registers the plugin, each case FAILS on its own
assertion: the probe's `pg` is a fixture nobody defines, so the child errors
where it should refuse or skip, and the filter's check cannot see the probe.
